# The Pharmakon of Being: Metabolic Capacity and Ontological Transformation

## Dark Intelligibility

Clarice Lispector is a voice that excited me a lot when I encountered her. I felt intimacy with the ways in which she relates to being. I discovered her as I became excited again of philosophy after encountering William Desmond. The two thinkers and writers share profound resonance, not least because they both defy strict categorization. Lispector in articulating rigorous philosophical thinking in her literary work, and Desmond for enacting the vulnerability and porosity that his systemic, open, philosophy propounds. A philosophy that doesn't sterilize poetry and is a living thought intimately getting to the heart of the matter. Lispector's writing on her part has the capacity to enact in the reader the process the character, G.H. is entangled in.

## The metaxu as overdetermined between

Desmond's concept of [[metaxu]]—the "between"—provides the framework for understanding how both thinkers navigate the space where intelligible and unintelligible meet. The metaxu is the rich ontological medium where different modes of being encounter each other. As Desmond explains in *Being and the Between*, "Nothing is defined through itself alone. Beings are defined in a rich ontological intermedium of happening, and are both other-relating and self-relating."[^2]

This "between" operates through what Desmond calls **"[[double mediation]]"**—both self-mediation (consciousness thinking itself through its other) and intermediation (the other's genuine mediation from its own otherness). Unlike dialectical thinking, which ultimately reduces otherness to self-relation, metaxological thinking maintains genuine plurality within unity. ( j: this is an essential point )

Lispector's literary practice embodies this same space of double mediation. In *The Passion According to G.H.*, the protagonist's encounter with the cockroach creates precisely such a metaxu—a space where human and non-human, subject and object, familiar and strange meet without reduction to dialectical unity. **The cockroach's "thick radiant indifference" becomes a gateway to what G.H. calls "inhuman life"**—not the opposite of human life, but life experienced from beyond the boundaries of human categorization.(j: this is still excellent and well articulated, flows well from desmond to Lispector)

Both thinkers understand this "between" as overdetermined rather than indeterminate. For Desmond, being presents itself as "surplus givenness"—an excessive abundance that gives rise to astonishment.(j: this can be linked to a citation about Desmond's astonishment) For Lispector, reality exceeds linguistic capture not through poverty but through richness: "reality is too delicate, only reality is delicate, my unreality and my imagination are heavier."(j: beautiful quote, needs page numbers)

## The Fundamental Ambiguity

The fundamental ambiguity of being is what I approach through the concept of the **Pharmakon of Being**. At once medicine and poison, the degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our 'metabolic capacity' for our ordeals. This capacity refers not merely to our intellectual understanding, but to our fundamental ability to digest reality in its unfiltered form—what Clarice Lispector calls the "saltless" truth.

In Lispector's *The Passion According to G.H.*, she confronts this ambiguity precisely: "How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation... to being." She confronts the fear deeply without trying to solve it, for the unknown as well as mysterious and sublime is terrifying. The violence of grace disorients the notion of self, placing us in the strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged.

## Salted vs. Saltless Reality

Being, I propose, comes to us in two fundamental forms: **salted** and **saltless**. Salted reality is digestible and palatable to human meaning-making—seasoned with significance, purpose, transcendence. It's what allows us to metabolize existence without being overwhelmed by its raw immediacy. But the **unsalted truth** is inhuman, without any trace of human seasoning. It's what Lispector encounters in the neutral gaze of the roach—reality before it has been processed through our interpretive apparatus.

"For salt I had always been ready, salt was the transcendence that I used to experience a taste, and to flee what I was calling 'nothing,'" Lispector writes. "But what my mouth wouldn't know how to understand—was the saltless." Salt becomes our pharmakon—it preserves and makes palatable, but also distances us from direct encounter with being's naked actuality.

## Metabolic Capacity as Ontological Development

Our **metabolic capacity** refers to our ability to digest increasingly stronger doses of unsalted reality without being destroyed by the encounter. Most consciousness can only subsist on pre-processed, humanly seasoned experience. But perhaps awareness can develop a greater metabolic range—learning to find nourishment in what initially appears toxic or indigestible.

This capacity is not merely intellectual but fundamentally somatic. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this viscerally: she must literally incorporate what repulses her human digestive system, vomiting first the civilized "milk and bread" of breakfast, then later spitting out the roach's matter while recognizing it as "taste of myself."

## The Ordeal and the Cracks

The **ordeal** is created when we realize the cracks in our mediating self—those inevitable fissures where the hyperintelligible breaks through our carefully maintained filters. The roach might indeed be an allegory for when the ordeal naturally brings us to trying, intimating a dialogue between our mediated being and our more primal being.

We are not cut off completely; cracks in our mediating self can expose us to our thing-part. Therefore it beckons us to step into truth, to recognize the full spectrum of being and shed our human chrysalis. But like the butterfly, consciousness must undergo transformation, decomposition even, to be reformed.

**Awakening is noticing the cracks; enlightenment is completely breaking open.** The hyperintelligible shines through with a vibratory trance—overwhelming, too much, striking us to our core because it *is* our core that we have actively tried to manage, filter, contain. But its wide life cannot be contained when the cracks are already revealed. Yet we must break our chrysalis ourselves to demonstrate our metabolic capacity.

## Somatic Knowing and the Sacred Purge

My concept of the pharmakon draws particularly from Plato's original formulation and Stiegler's technopharmacology, where writing itself becomes both poison and cure. Here I extend this logic to being itself: reality functions as pharmakon, requiring metabolic capacity to determine whether it nourishes or destroys consciousness.

This framework necessarily engages with **somatic knowing**—forms of intelligence that operate below the threshold of rational consciousness. As van der Kolk demonstrates in his work on trauma, "the body keeps the score." What we cannot metabolize consciously gets stored somatically, and what serves as protection to the self complicates our capacity for full metabolic engagement with reality.

**Repression is the banishment of forms of knowing to the body**, so it is no surprise when the body brings this knowledge back to consciousness through symptom, purge, or somatic release. The ayahuasca purge becomes paradigmatic here: the enacted vomiting happens in precise concert with the exact psychic content that the nausea evokes. We become sick unto ourselves—literally nauseated by our own undigested material—but precisely by passing through consciousness and being abjected, it is released. The purging becomes the ritual through which transformation occurs in relation to the contents of the purge.

Lispector's consumption of the "worse truth" and her subsequent vomiting underscores this somatic metabolism traversing from knowing into being—an ordeal that doesn't simply result from knowing but requires embodied enactment. Her body teaches her what her mind cannot yet process: that the roach's white matter and her own essential substance are not separate.

## The Neutral as Generative Emptiness

Lispector's "neutral" is paradoxically charged with its own vitality—what she calls "the great living neutrality struggling." It's not dead neutrality but **fertile neutrality**—neutral in its refusal to conform to human categories, yet generative in ways that exceed our usual notions of meaning.

The neutral gives her participation in what she calls "hopeless joy"—joy that doesn't convert into hope, that remains at the level of pure affirmation without projected futures or redemptive narratives. It's joy in suchness, in the bare fact that anything is at all. This is joy that has learned to metabolize neutrality without converting it into something else.

## Dark Intelligibility and Non-Propositional Knowing

**Dark Intelligibility** operates by giving equal weight to the light of reason and somatic ambiguity. The dark intelligibility of the body becomes a crucial form of non-propositional knowing that requires attunement and fidelity rather than analysis. This intelligence doesn't oppose rational thought but reveals its limits—the places where conceptual knowledge must give way to embodied wisdom.

In yoga practice, people often experience somatic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. This points to forms of knowing that operate through **metabolic wisdom**—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension.

Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this dark intelligibility in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being." The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

This dark intelligibility suggests that the pharmakon's dual nature—poison/medicine—is determined not only by our metabolic capacity but by our willingness to trust somatic intelligence even when it exceeds rational comprehension. The body often knows how to digest what the mind finds indigestible, but this requires a fundamental attunement to forms of knowing that operate below the threshold of ordinary consciousness.

## Toward Ontological Nutrition

This framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be sophisticated technologies for **metabolic development**—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range—learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on pure being without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

The roach encounter becomes a genuine philosophical experiment in **ontological nutrition**—testing whether human consciousness can learn to subsist on unsalted being, to find sustenance in neutrality itself. Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

The Pharmakon of Being ultimately names both the challenge and the promise of existence: the same reality that can dissolve unprepared consciousness becomes, for those with sufficient metabolic capacity, the deepest form of nourishment available to human awareness.

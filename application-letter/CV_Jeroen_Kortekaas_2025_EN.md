# Jeroen Kortekaas
## Content & Visual Strategist

As a designer and strategist (MA, Sandberg Institute), I work at the intersection of craft, technology, and commerce. My professional drive stems from a deep interest in the relationship between objects and their meaning, and how we can strengthen that relationship. My broad experience has shaped me into a versatile professional who is not only reflective but also a proactive maker and problem-solver.

AGAPEIC RESURRECTION
There is a self-transcending beyond erotic self-surpassing which yet is not the latter’s
opposite. It comes forth from the fertile void – in the equivocity of its plenitude/lack –
unclosed in erotic self-surpassing, but it arises from an intimation that we are already
given to be with (co-natus) a certain fullness, out of which we go beyond ourselves,
and not always to detour through the other back to ourselves again. Its ecstasis is not
from defect and as compensatory, but from abundance and from gratitude for being as
gift. The ground of this transcending is obscurely felt to be a fullness in the beginning,
remembered in the process of our unfolding, and not forgotten even in the determinate
fullness of attained self-becoming. The fullness, given in other-being, given in self-being,
is greeted with a gratitude, newly arriving out of refreshed astonishment. If erotic selftranscending tends to come forth from perplexity beyond determinate cognition, agapeic
self-transcendence arises beyond self-determination, with astonishment, once prior to
perplexity, now won again, at the end, out of perplexity, or perhaps suddenly simply
given to an expectant soul, long burdened by perplexity without relief. It arises beyond
determinacy and self-determination and rouses in us an overdeterminate expectancy relative to the ultimate source of the givenness of determinate being, and the endowed promise of our own being as self-determining.
I mark a fourfold deliverance towards the ethos of the between and its signs. First,
release towards the givenness of creation as an other, not there just for us, but having
its being and value for itself. Delivered to the world, one delights in its elemental being
there, in the glory of its aesthetic beauty, the unstrained gift of its availability. Agapeic
release towards creation is a love of the finite and mortal. This release – episodic and too
rare in us – may extend to beings normally deemed repulsive. One is abandoned to purposeless admiration at the strange good of other-being, suffered as unutterably precious
in its stunning thereness. Often this only happens in an extremity. A person confined
beholds the frail spider daily build and rebuild her web, beholds with a love keeping alive
the flame of faith in life. Laid low, one senses the same flame flare from the tiny patch
of sky, barely visible through the small window high above one. Failing one looks at the
long familiar tree, but the looking is a longing, exceeding every finite name. The signs are
in the incognitos of the everyday middle.
Second, there is a certain release of the abyss hidden in self-being. One goes out, out
of a porosity of selving that is also a too muchness. One is in excess of oneself, in excess
towards the other, because the idiocy of self-being is in excess of itself. And yet one is also
a kind of nothing. Selving too is a great mystery, enjoyed even more vitally when released
towards the singular inexhaustibility of the other. One has opened a door to this dark
abyss, too much and almost nothing, and found there many spectral residents – hideous guests, vile parasites, one’s own gargoyle self. One has entered into fearful converse
with the monstrous. A delivering may come, another energy of selving freed, by warring
with and making proper peace with one’s gargoyle shadow. The war does not destroy
but bends the deformed energy into a diviner form. Agapeic self-release is a release from
what one is, and a release of what one is, and was, always, though what one was and is
has corrupted the purer energy of ecstasis towards the other. The abyss of inward otherness is a source within selving of radical release, out of self towards the other as another
inexhaustible source for itself.
Third, there is a release towards the community of creation and self-being. I mean a
certain agapeic rapport between us and beings. It takes places in the aesthetic rapport,

in ethical solidarity, and in sacrificial love between us and other human beings. There
are many forms of community, but at the best it takes shape as agapeic service in which
being for the other transcends the insistences of being for self, even in the self’s warranted
claim to autonomy. There is a heteronomy revealed by agapeic release that has nothing
to do with an ab extra superimposition by a tyrannical or dominating other. The other
becomes the source of a solicitation that is a welcome rather than a demand, that delivers both self and other into a liberty beyond autonomy that lightly, even anonymously,
is there for the good of others.
Fourth, the otherness of given creation, the inward otherness of self-being, and especially this heteronomy beyond autonomy, deliver us to wonder about an other transcendence, other in a truly ultimate sense. The finite other, natural or human, release us to
mindfulness of transcendence as the ultimate other, and especially in the heteronomous
community that is agapeic service. This service is an ethical and religious service. Given
the absoluteness of availability for the other that is solicited, it is not defined relative
to various forms of instrumental relativity that have their place in the economy of selfinsistence and serviceable disposability, and even self-determining autonomy. Agapeic
service is a transcending beyond these, disproportionate to such finite systems of finite
exchanges. The service is not done from constraint or perplexity. It is the most elemental
thing to do. It is done as if without thought, and yet it asks the highest thoughtfulness
for the other, released from thought for self, from thought as for itself (see, inter alia, EB,
Chapter 16). One can, of course, be released towards oneself in the same spirit of surplus
generosity. This is true love of self.
We philosophers are sometimes poor servants of this agapeic release. It is hard to
assimilate to more familiar modes of explanation. The why at all of this service, this
should trouble us. It does not seek self-justification, but as a transcending of self, it
is self-justifying; and yet it is not done simply for itself. It is the enigmatic reversal of
self-transcendence into true transcendence of self, making us ponder if it is really transcendence as other (T³) that is the ultimate solicitation of our going beyond self. When
self-transcendence becomes transcendence of self, one goes out of oneself and counts for
nothing. This “counting for nothing” is the affirmative double that in its love counterparts the nihilistic form of “being nothing.” This “counting for nothing” is implicated
in the becoming of our highest self-transcending. It is the porosity of being between as
a love of the other. In another reversal, there is a peace to self, a satisfaction that is no
self-satisfaction, rather a resting in the good because one is being true to the good, and
again not because one can be happy with oneself because one had done the right thing;
the peace is that the good has been allowed to be, released to become in the travail of life.
One is at peace because one has been privileged somehow to participate in its passage.
See overall, then, the redoubled beginning beyond godlessness as the release of the
passion of being: the passio essendi intimate to the elemental “yes” and the aesthetic
re-charging; the passio secretly fermenting in erotic outreaching, despite the tendency of
the conatus essendi to take over; the passio now consumed in the porosity of agapeic communication, for love’s openness is not an empty lack but a passionate porosity, and at the
limit gives itself as a compassio essendi. The sacrificial compassion: this is the compassio
that makes sacred (sacer facere), and whose “being nothing” is the resurrection of the
agapeics of being.
How does all this relate to nihilism and the ethos of godlessness? The ethos appears
now as entirely other to devalued being. Such ontological valuelessness strikes one as
profoundly untrue. It is a catastrophic impoverishment, a lie against the abundance and
prodigality of life. Our perplexed wonder about God insinuates itself in this richness,
in the pleasure, enjoyment, and gratitude of agapeic release for this feast of being. The
release is entirely other to the will to power that rebels against, or exploits, or instrumentalizes, valueless being. Will to power might seem to make sense relative to the latter
ontological poverty. It is entirely inappropriate at this feast: a greedy boy grabbing at
a table with more than enough for everyone, including the greedy. There is a religious
poverty of being beyond this nihilistic poverty.
BEYOND GODLESSNESS 45
Agapeic release is more affirmative of being than even will to power that affirms its
own abundance (see IST?, Chapter 6); for the goodness of the other, as well as the self, is
to be affirmed; a more unequivocal release of self towards the other is entirely consonant
with the deepest truth of being. Our “counting for nothing,” lived in its full paradoxicality as a poverty of plenitude, can be the abandon of self-release that makes a way for
transcendence as other (T³) and always more than self-transcending (T²).
Will to power is conceived relative to an original ground understood as valueless.
By contrast, agapeic release to the ontological worth of creation solicits a rethinking
of the grounding origin, as giving being thus to be at all. This calls for a new quest of
the divine ground and its relativity to the finite between. There is a kind of ontological
marveling, in which thought is drawn towards its own deepening into praise. Thinking
can itself be, so to say, surprised by a kind of praying. Seeking God cannot be by way
of merely negating finite being; it must be by way of the surpluses of finite being. The
gratitude of agapeic release impels us to ask: What it is about the original ground that
gives such a release? Can we call it agapeic origin?
I stress: rebirth is still only a beginning. And I hear the snort: all this pretty talk about
“beginnings” is nebulous prating; a serious philosopher respects only what can be determinately and intelligibly articulated. Yes, yes: we do need more determinate articulation.
Yet, given the complex dimensions of this redoubled beginning, it is no mere indefiniteness, to be conquered by new conceptual univocities or speculative systems. Rather, it
enjoins a further turn towards the primal ethos, in mindfulness of a fuller feel for the
being-there of being and beings. Our opening to the surplus in the otherness of given
being can be complexly articulated, even if it exceeds all the determinations of intelligibility we muster. For again, if the other to thought thinking itself must be thought, and
thought otherwise, we are not giving up on thinking, but trying to think otherwise than
along the way that dead ends in nihilism. We now turn to more determinate thinking
concerning the divine, as defined by the guidances offered by the fourfold sense of being.
Along a winding way the question awaits us: Can we understand the ontological potencies of the ethos as the hyperboles of being that, read metaxologically, communicate in
the between the overdetermined signs of God?

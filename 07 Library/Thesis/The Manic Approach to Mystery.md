## Introduction

The aim for this text is to better understand the complex relationship between religion and art. Specifically, how spirituality functions in the realm of art and what can we learn from analyzing this relationship today. As an art student, I cannot hope to tackle this subject in its entirety. My specific focus is on the nature of the consciousness and the unconscious, specifically the function of the symbolizing qualities of the mind as it pertains to mystical experiences, or more generally, our imagination. The questions I intend to consider are: what is our psychological relationship to symbols? And, how can they so easily become a vehicle for our ideals, emotions, feelings, experience? In considering these questions, I will specifically deal with dreams, where the unconscious most commonly and directly creates images for us. These images can be absurd, horrific, or profound. The meaning we sensibly attach to these spontaneously created images produces symbols. Through those images the artist can create his own private mythologies, create personal meaning, and reconfigure constructed notions of self, society, religion and spirituality. Symbols are important in fueling our rich inner lives. They pervade our world, whether in our immediate reality or other realities. Art itself has inherently a symbolic nature. Carl Gustav Jung in his Red Book, shows how the rational and irrational have the possibility to meld together in one beautiful whole. This thesis attempts to draw a personal map of the spiritual in relation to art. Art is often largely preoccupied with concrete secular ideas, and only peripherally on its spirituality. However, many artists through their work express complex ideas which would benefit from an understanding of these concepts. If art fulfills a spiritual purpose, to what extent is this different to the functions of the field of religion?

Contemporary discussion of this subject can be found in James Elkins' On the Strange Place of Religion in Contemporary Art. In this book, Elkins offers insight into the problematic position of religion and the absence of spiritual discourse in contemporary art. This narrative is further expanded by David Morgan and Elkins in Re-Enchantment. Marco Pasi's essay A Gallery of Changing Gods: Contemporary Art and the Cultural Fashion of the Occult investigates the way the mystical or occult exhibits itself in art. Alena Alexandrova, who supervised my writing and research, provides a wealth of information in her dissertation Dis-continuities: The role of religious motifs in contemporary art which offers a narrative on the life of religious motifs in art. Other authors extend this further, offering new perspectives in the conversations about art and religion. These different narratives show the necessity for re-articulating this relationship in modern times, allowing a new lens on art through this complex subject.

## Dreaming up Images: the Symbol and the Unconscious

My interest in symbols stems from my own personal relationship with the unconscious and the relevance of this relationship in my work. My fascination with consciousness led me to be intrigued by its peculiarities. My own investigation, itself rooted in an unconscious fascination, explored images and symbols that spontaneously—or following experience—manifest in the mind. These images and symbols became part of a regular internal dialogue, my imaginary companions.

Generally speaking, the symbolizing faculties of the mind are important for thought. Indeed, symbols are the material from which thought is often formed. This symbolizing mind may be best evident in dreams, in which we directly experience the minds' symbols. But I would include mental imagery of any kind in the mind's symbolizing faculties, with even the vaguest hint of significance of a notion, or the mere 'aftertaste' of an experience.

Dreams, as Carl G. Jung has shown, are important for analyzing the unconscious. This is true for the psycho-analyst, who attempts to map out the mind. Yet the unconscious plays a big role in all our lives. For the shaman, dreams and the unconscious have a mystical albeit similar importance. Non-ordinary states of consciousness are used to commune with spirits, self and community in order to heal and guide. In the case of the shaman, and more generally, 'primitive' societies, we find an emphasis on the relationship with the symbolizing mind, which acknowledges a liveliness of our inner worlds largely absent today. This recalls the notion of animism, our first religion; the perception of life in our immediate environment, visions, dreams, man-made objects and so on. Yet more clearly it is the recognition of the "tremendous animation of the unconscious"¹ that Jung speaks of, which fills us and our realities with lively images. A key interest for me is this relationship between the mind's symbolizing faculties and its drive to create meaning.

In Jung's last book, Man and his Symbols—which he finished editing 10 days before he died—he emphasizes the importance of the symbolizing mind. Throughout the book, he argues for knowledge and acceptance of the unconscious to reach wholeness, on personal and collective level. Such a lens on the mind is absent today, and rarely do we wonder about the absurd manifestations of dreams. It is only when we are confronted with something particularly jarring that we start thinking of what it means.

I recall one day which sparked such a jarring and personally significant dream. I was on a train to Arnhem, writing early parts of this text. Gradually I got sucked into writing, and liberated by the sudden impetus my mind became manic. Incoherence seeped in due to this wild unfiltered rush of thought, it was an exciting thrill, and left me in a heightened state for the rest of the day. Energized, I visited there the modern art museum. All the while my mind was spinning with ideas and quick, rabid observations. At home, I continued writing well into the evening and could not sleep when I tried. Nearly feverish, my mind raced on, touching deeply inside in order to reach something I could not. An unfathomable feeling slowly became palpable, feeling on the verge of some point. Sleep seemed impossible. When it finally happened, I noticed something was different. From a waking state, I fell directly into a lucid internal reality. I experienced an intensely physical sensation of spherical fields of consciousness, distorting and bubbling in the air across a dark lamp-lit street, one field was myself—a replacement of my body with this energy field—and the other was not. Both we were speeding across the road and expanding upward in the cold firmament of the night, gaining power that felt infinite, terrifyingly so. The sense of power was oceanic. It was too much, and upon waking, the thrill I had felt earlier transformed into fear and confusion. There was no hope of comprehending what had happened when I woke up. Slowly, heart racing and sweating profusely, I tried to calm down and regain composure. After some tossing and turning, sleep took me once more and I now envisioned in front of me a massive sculpture of a mask made up out of hexagonal gold links with enamels in the primary colors, such as those on Tibetan prayer flags. It appeared to be a ritualistic version of chain-mail, it covered an empty space inside it, and made a monumental impression. It was sublime, silent and sacred. I felt a sense of relief that something had been concealed, something too sacred to witness. It toned down the overwhelming nature of the experience. After this encounter, the dream continued to move around in a lucid fashion, but quickly became more typically dream-like. It was as if I was slowly sinking back into my old self, and fatigue dragged my dream into lost memory.

Such a dream may not be everyday, but it revealed to me the intensity with which these dream-images can occur. It is clear that this vision was the product of my state of mind at that time, but its unique nature made me curious. The question of whether such a vision or dream either represents an encounter of divine entities or is completely self-imagined does not matter so much here, as the experience was real and shocking enough to take seriously in any case. In the dream, the feeling of an infinite power is sensually experienced. The experience is coupled with the imagery, which attains greater significance. The image of the mask was not new to me, I had previously seen such a mask in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones—worn by a mysterious priestess called Quaithe. In the series, she briefly appears prophesize a main character's fate in the form of a riddle (fig. 1). The narrative aspect of the motif might offer a clue as to why the mind would present such an image. The greater mystery of the dream lies hidden beneath the surface, and is something which requires an in-depth analysis on its own.

The essential questions that flow out of this are, basically, how does our symbolizing mind deal with us, especially in moments of crisis, or ecstasy? And, in what lies the transformative power of such experiences? Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, in his famous essay The Effectiveness of Symbols, describes the similarities between shamanism and psychoanalysis. Both have the purpose to “[...] bring to a conscious level conflicts and resistances which have remained unconscious,"² not because of a knowledge, "real or alleged", which becomes acquired, but because the knowledge makes possible the experience which leads to resolution of the conflict. This process is called abreaction in psychoanalysis, and can also happen through dreams. In this case, the experience of the ineffable is made 'intelligible' through mediation of the sensuous symbols in the mind. The unconscious reaches an understanding, not by way of concrete conceptuality, but through the sensuous image. With this 'understanding', we reach resolution of the crisis. Lévi-Strauss gives the case of a Cuna shaman, who, when called by a midwife to a difficult childbirth, assists the woman in a ritual which includes neither medicine nor the altered state of the shaman or patient. Rather, it requires the shaman to cast an incantation in the mode of a magical-religious song which—through the collective spiritual symbolism of their culture—depicts the difficult birth as an imbalance of vital forces. The mythical song about struggle becomes significant for the woman's own struggle, which begins to live through the song. The pain becomes understood through the song, which depicts the battle through physiological metaphors that blur the boundary between the cosmic battle and her physical pains, the divine and her body. Lévi-Strauss notes that the shamanistic cure seems an exact counterpart to the psychoanalytic cure, the notable difference being that in one case the patient constructs an individual myth with elements from his past, and in the other case, the patient receives a social myth from the outside. "The psychoanalyst listens, whereas the shaman speaks."³ In both cases however, myth creation and symbolism form an important tool for creating order out of chaos, understanding out of pain. Through psychoanalysis there is the attempt to put such methods into rational frameworks. My own experience can be seen in as as process of ‘abreaction’. But to what extent can we dissect the mystery, before it becomes a dead intellectualization?

## Sublime Feeling and Sensical Nonsense

Spiritual experience can more generally be explained through the sublime. Etymologically, the 'sublime' finds its root in the Latin sublimis (elevated, exalted, lofty) derived from sub, ‘beneath' or 'up to' and limes meaning limit or boundary, and perhaps limen referring to a threshold. The alchemical notion of 'sublimation' is still used in modern chemistry, except without the mystical connotation of transmutation in relation to the attainment of higher spiritual states. The sublime of the Romantic era is characterized by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe as ‘the incommensurability of the sensible with the metaphysical (the Idea, God)'⁴. Edmund Burke in his seminal book A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origins of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful (1757) described the violent astonishment in face-to-face with the immensity and greatness of nature. Astonishment, like fear, ceases everything in the mind except its object. Burke declared the sublime as 'the strongest passion', a transformative power that is terrifying and yet noble. Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgement (1790) adopts ideas from Burke and extends them. Kant situates the sublime as essentially a negative experience of limits. He described it as the inability of our imagination or concept to reach any coherent account of an experience. Characteristic in this sublime is the movement of pain to pleasure, the failure of imagination to contain the Idea results in pain, yet also a kind of pleasant thrill, “a certain tranquility mingled with terror."⁵

The discourse around the sublime, old and contemporary, informs the way in which spiritual experiences can be reformulated in modern times. Such notions as the sublime are sometimes used to 'covertly smuggle in ideas' which used to fall within religious discourse. This schism points to a need to reconfigure spiritual language from the language of religion. The reinvention or reconfiguration of spiritual language to discuss these ideas is simultaneous with the invention of new images, through art.

The fear and confusion of the unfathomable encountered in the divine experience lies in our inability to rationally cognize it, to decipher its message, its riddled truth. Yet the mind is thoroughly enthralled and convinced by this experience. To be sure, the pleasure derived from it is certainly often a tremendous thrill. In this, it is not the immensity of nature (the external object) which obliterates us, as with Burke, but through simply the mind's own attempt to grasp the divine. Through this, the mind's own capability to elevate itself above nature becomes visible. Our mind creates and confronts the divine purely in itself. Like in the sublime, reason's limit is experienced through the absurdity and tremendous terror of the experience.

The relief upon seeing the images produced in such an experience, may lie in the fact that they allow for sensuous understanding, rather than being concrete knowledge. The morbid fascination we experience from their appearance in the mind, how they are paradoxically plainly visible, yet resist presentation, is strange. They have the quality of a Möbius strip, except the trick or illusion is not visible. It is, as Jean-François Lyotard describes the sublime, “an imagination striving to even figure even that which cannot be figured"⁶, but instead of the characteristic failure in the sublime, we reach a half-success. Here, our mind is also transported to a limit, yet the image is what takes us over the threshold. Their truths transcend reason.

Jung is an essential part of this puzzle. The psyche that Jung talks of is the psyche of the depths, where our thoughts and feelings, at the limit of language, manifest in the form of sensuous images, entities, symbols. A cornucopia of images that continuously flow into the mental world, that we may not even be the author of, like the heart is as much part of the mind, despite us not being able to stop it's beat, the dizzying whirl of consciousness ceaselessly rotates, around our small mental space, which is seemingly driven to utterance of a singularly transcendent idea. This resembles Jung's 'supreme meaning'⁷, which is at the same time a thought and an image. It is cold and hot, the highest truth and the most absurd, meaning and meaninglessness, the concealment and unveiling in one act. These images that we receive from our 'spirit of the depth' are at once profoundly personal and of a collective universality. They challenge, shatter our beliefs, transporting the person to void and horror on the one hand, or transcendence of the divine on the other. This is illustrated by Jung through the god Abraxas, in The Seven Sermons to the Dead. Abraxas is the god which unifies good and evil in the world. It is creation and destruction simultaneously, the devil and God conjoined (fig. 2).

Understanding such as this is symbolic in itself. The symbolic in art and religion from Hegel's philosophy is explored by Kathleen Dow Magnus in Hegel and the Symbolic Mediation of Spirit. She acknowledges that symbols fail to make their meaning completely clear, but at the same time bring associations that extend beyond the meaning they half-reveal. This lack of clarity and excess of association prevents the symbol from conveying its meaning unambiguously. The ambiguity and excess of association is a key quality of the symbol that similarly holds relevance in art and religion. The associative power reaches out in the void and manages to suck in something else.

I encountered the 'excess of association' in a rather unusual place. Early in the morning, I was waiting for the first train, at Amsterdam Sloterdijk. The light of the station clock suddenly in my sparked a recognition in me, a union with an inner image I had seen before in a vision, but which I could not recall clearly. The Dutch station has milky white plexiglass which is backlit, and on it is jutted by blue hour and minute hands and blue rounded hour markers, and a red second hand (fig. 3). Suddenly the design, the face, acquired a body of connection which seemingly snapped into place. I felt a presence well up in me, which manifested itself through this clock. The hairs on the back of my neck rose, violently. This experience was unfathomable to me, and remained in my mind, unexplained. Weeks later, I had a completely absurd dream in which this station clock appeared levitating mid-air, bulging and simplified, ablaze in blue flames. It appeared as the embodiment of a key inner image I felt connected to. The clock was by this point entrenched in my mind. Private (and collective) symbols may generate these connections to immediate images on the basis of likeness, and perhaps this clock bore enough of a resemblance to acquire embodiment of this inner image. This connection on the basis of obscure similarity to the mind generated symbol demonstrates the power of the unconscious, fluidity of mind and our drive to make the unknown known.

Whatever grotesque over-inflation of meaning for me now occupies the station clock, it was essentially an obscure inner image which escaped into an immediate one, transforming it. Like the symbol, it does not adequately contain the original image and its private psychic power, but as the genie who is captured in a lamp, attains embodiment of it. Like the genie, who is fleeting and mutable, it can escape. The inner image can find associative power in other symbolic containers. Or, this psychic image becomes potentiated in its new form, where it takes firm hold. What the image came to represent exactly I do not know, I just had the obscure sense of its significance, as if the divine was seeking to be known by me through this strange way, or conversely, as if I had sought to know it in this way. We can tie this to Jung's notion of supreme meaning and its paradoxical nature. The station clock, absurdly, had the possibility to contain this private meaning. The station clock became for me a mandala⁸ of the Self in connection to the divine, and through this is at once anthropomorphic and ‘theomorphic’, in the sense that it attains both an individual and transcendent meaning.

This moment of capturing the ‘genie in the lamp’ was crucial for me. The experience which revealed to me the manner in which the mind produces and alters symbols in order to conceive or sensuously apprehend ideas that exceed the limit of rationality or cannot be brought in conception. In miraculous fashion the unpresentable found presentation. This brings forth the question of how art assists us in the reflection on such images. It should be clear that the mediation of the symbolic finds immediate presence in the field of art. Through art, such a mediation of internal symbols, images from dreams—conscious or unconsciously—can bring us in direct relationship to these psychic images.

He robbed me of speech and writing for everything that was not in his service, namely the melting together of sense and nonsense, which produces the supreme meaning. God is an image, and those who worship him must worship him in the images of the supreme meaning.”  
⁸ Mandala in Sanskrit literally means 'circle' or 'power circle'. Aniela Jaffé, a close co-worker of Jung, saw the circle and sphere as a symbol of the Self. "It expresses the totality of the psyche in all its aspects, including the relationship between man and the whole of nature." from Aniela Jaffé, “ Symbolism in Visual Arts”, in Man and His Symbols, p.213.

## Art and the Mystical Experience: Echoes and Absurdity

The symbol proves to be an intricate part of how we form ideas. It is an important aspect in both art and religion. We can look at the symbol through Hegel's philosophy of spirit. Hegel is sometimes criticized for using the word 'spirit' without qualification "to designate both God and man."⁹ Spirit, for Hegel, is the meeting point between the divine and human. Both art and religion involve spirit's coming to knowledge of itself. Yet only art grants spirit the unique experience of itself externalized in its ‘other'. According to Hegel, spirit can never find adequate embodiment in this form, yet these expressions are necessary in order for spirit to know itself absolutely. The inadequacy for matter to contain spirit in harmony constitutes for Hegel the limit of art. Yet the importance of this inadequacy lies in spirit becoming conscious of lacking consciousness, which is according to Kathleen Dow Magnus is an experience necessary for spirit's completeness, or 'absolute determination'.¹⁰ Both art and religion appeal directly, intuitively, and through the use of symbols and metaphors, to the conscious and unconscious understanding of truth. Magnus states: "When spirit becomes aware of its intrinsic unity with that which appears other than it—before full self-consciousness, it experiences this identity through symbolizations.”¹¹ Hegel's notion of spirit evokes the similarities and purpose for these various different forms, and the importance of the symbolic in them.

According to Hegel, by becoming aware of its symbolizations, spirit reaches a unity with its external ‘other'. The artist begins with a certain significance and then identifies this significance with a 'comparable, similar appearance of concrete reality.' Ultimately, Hegel's ideas of symbolic form point to his stages of development of artistic consciousness: he considers these symbolic forms mainly as the result of the poetic drive to express spiritual meaning in new ways. Yet it will always stay symbolic, and point beyond itself to its suggested meaning.

As James Elkins writes in his book On the Strange Place of Religion in Contemporary Art, the unconscious struggle with the symbolic in art can be understood as religious, even though an artist would not consider it religious or spiritual as such. Elkins mentions a student of his who was obsessed with a heart-like symbol, and driven to reproduce it in various forms. What the student was depicting is not clear, however it is clear that it is beyond the general meaning of the symbol. This unconscious religion is for Elkins' the point where art-making can take on a similar roles as those of religion. The symbol in this case might be the student's genie bottle.

An artist who specifically reflects on spiritual experience is Bill Viola (1951). In an interview, he recounts an accident he had as a child when he fell into a lake. Sinking to the bottom: “I saw the most beautiful world I have ever seen, it was colorful and there was light, and these plants were moving. [...] I see it constantly in my mind and my minds' eye."¹² He also describes his first encounter with film, in a later high-school workshop. Upon seeing the camera light up an emanating blue light, he was captivated. “That was the light I remembered from the water.”, he describes. A recurring appearance of a striking similarity to the experience may 'flood' back the memory, or partially invoke again the awe felt in the experience. In Bill Viola's video works water takes a central role, such as in The Crossing (1996, fig. 4), in which a double-sided projection simultaneously shows a figure slowly being engulfed in flame on one side, and cascaded by water on the reverse-side, as a roaring sound slowly crescendos. Here, fire and water, the dual elements, are tremendous and terrifying, exhilarating and beautiful, energetic and powerful, but also purifying. The significance of his childhood experience is consolidated in his interest in water, which is present throughout his work. Through the work, such a sensuous connection to a subject may serve not only to illustrate such a relationship, but to create work which is constantly in connection to that earlier mystery. The work of Viola is quite clearly channeling the nature of spiritual experience. His work reconfigures spiritual concepts and motifs through the medium of video, a reconfiguration which takes place in the spaces of galleries and museums. Regardless of his religious practice, his interest religious experience is clear. The line between spiritual practice and artistic practice also becomes indistinct in the work. But subliminally, this interest may always have been empowered by this single transformative experience he had as a child. The memory of such an experience may be lost, repressed, or simply become unconscious. Yet its enchanting power still continues to reverberate. We cannot escape these echoes. The artist who tunes in to them, creates in himself again the enchanting power of this memory. We may not at first even realize we are dealing with a previous experience. But staying 'true' to our nature, we have no option but to submit to the siren song of even manifestly unconscious memory.

This symbolic form is like a tightly wound knot that needs to be untangled. The impetus is to bring to light exactly what truth the symbol contains, to what extent that is possible. At the limit of that expression, we have symbols as the dubious container for the unpresentable. A leap of faith seems necessary for the struggle with objects of psychic power to become consciously spiritual. I am thinking here of Kierkegaard's ideas. Faith in Kierkegaard's terms is the leap to the absurd required for the religious. Passion and faith according to Kierkegaard is what rushes into matters enthusiastically, reflection is the disinterested intellectualization and scrutiny of matters. Passion is in this sense the creative force, and reflection its constant scrutiny. The absurd, in Kierkegaard's terminology, bears resemblance to the notion of the sublime. It is defined as that which cannot be rationally explained or justified in any way, and which transcends all human and intelligible possibility.

An artist who would fall under the category 'leap to the absurd' is Paul Lafolley (1935-2015). Laffoley's works consist mainly of square diagrammatic paintings concerning consciousness and mystical experience, architecture, philosophy, time travel, aliens, astrology, to name a few. His work contains expressive color, precisely rendered spirals, wheels, swastikas, hexagrams, pentagrams and architectural forms. It is densely packed with text, often dualistically arranged oppositional, in relation to each other with vinyl press-on letters. Complex metaphysical ideas are linked, arranged, put into 'force' structures.

Lafolley is a peculiar figure, from an artistic perspective and the perspective of mysticism. From his childhood, he was obsessed with UFOs, and reportedly watched The Day the Earth Stood Still 873 times. He vowed to become an architect, so that he could design flying saucers. His father, a banker, had cultivated an interest in occultism and Eastern faiths, performing on the side as a trance medium. When Lafolley was diagnosed with mild Asperger's Syndrome, he found himself in the tutelage of an Indian Brahmin who taught math at Harvard. All this was fertile ground for his later development. After completing his bachelor in art, he attempted architecture at Harvard but left after it became clear he didn't fit in. But during his bachelor he underwent psychiatric treatment, with eight sessions of electroshock therapy for "a mild state of catatonia". He managed to apprentice with sculptor Mirko Baseldella, and later in New York with visionary architect Frederick Kiesler. In 1968 he moved into a small studio, creating the one-man Boston Visionary Cell. He briefly lived at Andy Warhol's studio, in compensation he would watch television for Warhol, and 'report' to him what he saw. Mainly, 'Indian-head test patterns' (fig. 5), which have the mandala-schematic ring to them which governs most of Laffoley's work.

His interest in extraterrestrials is compounded by the obscure nature of his mystical experiences, some reportedly facilitated through "electroshock séance"¹³ As far as I know, Laffoley's experiences are not well documented. What follows is the general story that is told: During a routine CAT-scan of his head in 1992, a miniature metallic implant, 3/8 of an inch long, was discovered in the occipital lobe of his brain, near the pineal gland. Local M.U.F.O.N. investigators declared it to be an alien nano-technological laboratory. He has come to believe that the "implant" is extraterrestrial in origin and is the main motivation behind his ideas and theories, capable of retarding or accelerating his brain activity.

It is curious, of course, to imagine the truth of this. It certainly fits into his life. There is no doubt that his spiritual life had a highly eccentric direction, which at once evokes a degree of skepticism but at the same time appeals with a sense of authenticity. His 'mental condition' may have spurred the ultimate devotion to his ideas, a kind of spiritual 'savant', both afflicted and benefiting from his psyche. The metaphysical science-fiction realities of his paintings, or as he calls them 'consciousness mass interaction devices', hold the magical claim that they transmit information beyond dimensionality, and require a leap to the absurd Lafolley has no trouble making.

Alien contact is no different, it seems, from an experience of meeting Christ, God, or other spiritual entities. These experiences which archetypically communicate information to us sensuously, which we then have to untangle ourselves. A beam of light, an elevator or train, takes us up into a glowing spinning disk, the unfathomable 'other', which we encounter ‘out there' outside ourselves, beyond the dimensionality of our normal mental realms, we see our soul, we see God, a god or gods, we reach the point of Alpha and Omega, or we become surgically modified by aliens. Here as well we should recognize the immense power and animation of the unconscious. An unconscious which is often transcendental, external and wholly other. Is there something in us which corresponds to that alien surgeon? Is it part of us, or something else? We cannot pretend to understand the powers which live through us, but we can connect to them, if we can allow such connections into our modern world.

## Conclusion

Writing this text was for me lay in a continuous creation and destruction of my own pre-conceptions. I have now reached a new temporary sense of meaning, which is at the same time in the process of decay, and out of which the next meaning will grow. In an LSD experience, the world is tugged and transformed, destroyed and mangled, with new orders built on its surface. Upon blinking, that order vanishes, this utterance returned to starting point, from where it departs again, wildly growing from the surfaces of objects. It is unfixed and constantly in whirl, like so many things in life which we perceive as fixed, despite being only passing, illusory truths.

The images generated by the mind create a wide spectrum of investigation. They are the essential aspect I arrived on in this text, even though I looked for it in many misleading places. These images themselves seem to express that which we cannot give form. These images seem to generate independently of us, regardless of our will. Yet inherent in them is a convincing sense of their profound truth. Our thought is reflected in the sensuous image, which captures our feeling and true yearning more clearly than we can express. As such, we should not speak of a superiority of mind over nature, but a superiority of image over mind. We come to know our self in this 'external' other, and we realize our unity with that which appears other to us. These are the images that bubble up and are formed, without our effort, and which poetically portray the truths we struggle with. Through recognizing their integral part in us, we come to know our self in a radically different way.

The secret aim of this text was to come to a closer understanding of the ineffable and inexpressible. The underlying question: where is the basis to understand these experiences in our modern day? We can look for it in many places. Today's interests are fractured and specialized. We may find it in surprising places. There might be areas of synthesis, in between the realms of theology, psychoanalysis, philosophy, art, material science, and so on. Such areas could alchemically join these fractured fields back together, completing the process of seperatio and coniunctio.

Early in my research I stumbled on the theosophical motivations of early nineteenth century artists. The Theosophical Society and figures like Madame Blavatsky and Eduoard Schuré were inspirational for a generation of artists. Artists such as Hilma af Klint, Piet Mondriaan, Constantin Brancusi and others. I rediscovered their works through these ideas, and was surprised by the influence of this movement on their philosophical thought. Now these cases are more widely researched, and their significance becomes more apparent. Today such a relationship may be more complex. At the start of the twentieth century, Edouard Schuré, in his conclusion to L'Evolution Divine envisions art as “the inspired interpreter, the hierophant and torchbearer of integral Science and universal Religion." He saw a future religion which would be highly artistic, resolving the dichotomies between science and spirituality. Such a future may not be at hand. I am however convinced of art's personal and collective healing qualities, and can see it as part of our 'bridges to the divine'.

The realm of mystical experience, even the mere acknowledgement of our inner realities is today marginalized, and based on preconceptions. It is not easy to write about this. To be sure, Marco Pasi says as much in his essay A Gallery of Changing Gods: Contemporary Art and the Cultural Fashion of the Occult. In it, he describes the ways in which the esoteric, occult and mystical, generally represents itself in art. The most interesting manifestation of this he mentions is the art which results directly from inspiration or communication with spiritual entities, or from a visionary/mystical experience. It is simultaneously, as Pasi notes, the most problematic—as these experiences are, in our western world, most readily dismissed. This area however is interesting, Pasi observes, for those who wish to 'develop forms of cultural criticism, resistance and opposition.' These alternative realities accessible through the forms of altered consciousness, pushes these artists to create an artistic language that develops in progressive directions. “They explore the unknown, uncharted territories of the mind, sometimes with an ironic smile of detachment. Sometimes."

To capture the genie in its bottle is a highly intimate moment. Through it, you can create your own mythologies. To bring them into existence through art, is a profoundly personal act. It ignites the fire of our personal terrors and leads the person to the darker and lighter aspects of their Self. The work of art can mediate the "streams of consciousness which threaten to break us". It extends our experience, our inner realities, directly into the world. It entwines reality with our inner reality, and explores that experience with a sense of devotion and meaning. The process of making once again makes hairs on the back of one's rise and brings about a connection with the depths. The mind goes to great lengths to wrestle this into clarity, to the point where we realize that impossibility. We do not answer the question. We are firmly fixed in a cloud of unknowing. In communion with ourselves, we are not solving a mystery. We only come into its presence.

## Image References

- **Fig. 1** A Hexagonal mask, worn in HBO's television series Game of Thrones by a mysterious priestess. This prop recalls the sculpture that I encountered in my dream. In the series she prophesizes a main character's fate in the form of a riddle. The narrative aspect of the motif might offer a clue why the unconscious would produce such an image.
    
- **Fig. 2** Several depictions of Abraxas, specifically those reproduced from antique gemstones called 'Abraxas stones'. Carl Jung in his mystical Septem Sermones ad Mortuous (1916, The Seven Sermons to the Dead) describes Abraxas as God and devil conjoined, transcending opposition. Plate from Bernard de Montfaucon, L’antiquité expliquée et représentée en figure (1719-1724).
    
- **Fig. 3** A Dutch station clock, based on the famous design by the Swiss Hans Hilfiker. The design became a Swiss national icon and similarly this particular face can be seen as a Dutch icon, due to its usage. We can see the station clock as a mandala in much the same way as many other circular symbols and motifs throughout the world. Naturally this clock also has an entire associative power of its own, but this illustrates how such an image can hold a psychic power.
    
- **Fig. 4** The Crossing, Bill Viola (1996) 10'57", 2-channel screen projection with sound on separate back-to-back screens suspended from the ceiling.
    
- **Fig. 5** (below) An 'Indian-head test pattern' used in television broadcasting before 1970.
    
- **Fig. 6** (right) Paul Lafolley, Thanaton III (1989). Lafolley was convinced that extraterrestrials had transmitted to him information beyond the realm of dimensionality, but as he did not understand all of the information, he felt he had to communicate it through his paintings to others who might understand the message. Because of this he calls his paintings 'mass consciousness interaction devices', and had to be approached, touched, stared into. Other than this magical claim the painting is annotated as a homage to various artists, philosophers, mathematicians, writers, scientist, architects, and so on—spanning his eclectic and almost manic interest in their subjects.
    
- **Fig. 7** Mandala painting by Carl Jung, Liber Novus, The Red Book, p.107. Shows a 4 rayed celtic cross, adorned with a knotted lines weaving across the circle and the rays. Jung saw mandalas as a graphical presentation of the Self. In Memories, Dreams, Reflections, he writes "I had the distinct feeling that they were something central, and in time I acquired through them a living conception of the self. The self, I thought, was like the monad which I am, and which is my world. The mandala represents this monad, and corresponds to the microcosmic nature of the psyche." p.189. The painting and drawing of mandalas is widely used in Jungian psychoanalysis, yet for Jung was also a distinctly mystical practice.

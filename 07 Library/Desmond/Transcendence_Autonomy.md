First transcendence (T¹): The transcendence of beings as other in exteriority. The transcendence of such beings consists in their not being the product of our process of thinking;
their otherness to us resists complete reduction to our categories, especially in so far as they
simply are at all. Their otherness as being at all gives rise to the question: What makes possible both their possibility, as well as their actuality? What makes possible the possibility
of their being at all? This is a metaphysical question not about the “what” of their being
but the “that” of their being there at all: Why beings and not nothing? The possibility of a
further transcendence as other to their transcendence is opened by such questions.
Second transcendence (T²): The transcendence of self-being, self-transcendence. The
meaning of possibility is here realized in interiority rather than determined externally.
Human self-transcendence is of special moment here. There is possibility as freedom, as
the promise of self-determination. We are impelled to the further question: Is this self-transcendence, in relation to the first transcendence (T¹), an anomalous overreaching into emptiness, or a genuine self-surpassing towards an even further transcendence as other? Is our
self-surpassing driven by a lack to fulfill only itself, or to seeking fulfillment in what is other
to itself? Is it more than lacking and seeking what is infinitely more than itself, whether
lacking or not? An important question here: Does our understanding of our own self-transcending rely too much on the conatus essendi and not enough on the passio essendi?
Third Transcendence (T³): original transcendence as still other – transcendence itself,
not as the exterior, not as the interior, but as the superior. This would be a hyperbolic
sense of transcendence, bringing to mind the question of God beyond the immanence of
transcendence in nature and human being. If we were to call this third hyperbolic form
“Transcendence itself,” it would be in excess of determinate beings, as their original 
GODLESSNESS AND THE ETHOS OF BEING 23
ground; it would be beyond human self-transcendence, as its most ultimate possibilizing
source. It would also be beyond the ordinary doublet of possibility/reality, as their most
ultimate possibilizing source. It would not be just a possibility, nor indeed a determinate
realization of possibility. It would have to be “real” possibilizing power, in a manner
more original and other than immanent possibility and realization. It would have to
be original, creative possibilizing beyond determinate possibility, and “real” beyond all
determinate realization, beyond all self-determining self-realization.
If such third transcendence were in excess of determinacy and our self-determining,
would it be but a merely indefinite beyond to finite being? If so, would not its participation in the happening of the between be feeble? Is there rather a third transcendence that
is not such an empty indefinite but excessive: overdetermined in a surplus sense, hyperbolic, not indefinite? If so, it would not be comprehended under any finite category of
the possible or real. It would be above, huper, über them, and yet most intimate to finite
being as enabling it to be at all, and to be free. What must this possibilizing power be,
such as to give rise to finite being as other to itself, and hence as possibilizing the finite
space, or middle, for first and second transcendence? Such a third transcendence could
not be identified with any projection onto some ultimate other of the first two senses.
There could be no objectification (T¹) or subjectification (T²) of third transcendence (T³).
Rather it would seem that second transcendence (T²), in its ineradicable recalcitrance to
complete objectification, is pointed beyond both objectness and subjectness to transobjective and transsubjective transcendence (T³). And perhaps first transcendence (T¹) is
not also devoid of its own ambiguous signs of this hyperbolic transcendence.
Much more must be said, but for now this is the relevant point.2
 Third transcendence
(T³) has been made problematic in modernity, both by a univocalizing objectification of
first transcendence (T¹), and by developments of second transcendence (T²), especially
when this last defines itself hugely in terms of its own autonomy. Then a logic of selfdetermination stands guard over all our thinking, and the thinking of what is other to our
self-determination. Inevitably, third transcendence (T³) becomes endowed with an equivocal position. There is a tension, indeed an antinomy, between autonomy and transcendence.
This is not just a mere contradiction, but a tension wherein different possibilities for human
thought and life take shape. In this equivocal space the traditional respect accorded to
third transcendence (T³) from an essentially religious point of view comes under onslaught.
Into that space of equivocality, our “creativity,” our “poetry,” so to speak, inserts itself,
as somehow answering the tension of autonomy and transcendence. Human “art” comes
to assume roles previously accorded to religion. Is the antinomy resolved? Or does third
transcendence still remain mockingly “beyond” – or welcoming?

p.22-23

THE ANTINOMY OF AUTONOMY AND TRANSCENDENCE
What might be said here of this antinomy of autonomy and transcendence? The ideal of
autonomy accents our determining power; it may indeed grant our relatedness to others,
yet the primary stress is on self-determining, the nomos of the auto. By contrast, transcendence must put the stress on the importance of otherness; for the trans is a going beyond or
across towards what is not now oneself. If God is third transcendence, there is an otherness
not reducible to our self-determining. Third transcendence cannot univocally coexist
with an absolutized autonomy which is absolutely for itself. Alternatives: if autonomy is
primary, third transcendence has to be subordinated; if third transcendence is primary,
autonomy cannot be absolute. Western modernity generally has opted for some version
of the first alternative, with incalculable consequences for the second.
2
 We will come to explore the connections between these different senses of transcendences and the
hyperboles of being: T¹ is perhaps more intimately tied to the idiotic and aesthetic, T² and T³ (especially with respect to the porosity and passage between them) are more bound up with the erotic and
the agapeic. 3
 See AOO, Chapter 8 “Art and the Impossible Burden of Transcendence,” where I also remark on the postmodern response to the antinomy, which tends to equivocate between the aesthetic and the religious.
24 GODLESSNESS
The choice is more complicated in that the need of transcendence does not die, cannot
die. Indeed autonomy is a formation of self itself derived from an energy of transcendence of which we are first beneficiaries rather than possessors. Something of this may
even be granted when we acknowledge that the human being is an immanent transcending power. This power is self-transcendence (T²). And so we are tempted to say that in
self-transcendence we have both autonomy and immanent transcendence; we have no
need for an other transcendence.
Can we sustain this reassurance? Suppose we find ourselves, so to speak, slipping
below the surface of our own self-transcendence? Open the door into this dark, and what
then? What answers this opening is itself a new darkness. The more our self-transcending delves into its own immanent power, the more enigmatic that power comes to seem,
and the less we are assured of our autonomy. Our self-transcendence goes beyond itself
to what as outer is other, but it also goes beyond itself into its immanent resources, into
depths bottomless, depths murky, depths terrifying. The infinite restlessness of human
selving in its outward throw shows to us the external side of an infinitely enigmatic abyss
in inwardness itself. Step into that abyss and the warm self-esteem of autonomy will soon
shiver in strange icy blasts that blow from undiscovered bourns. There is an inward otherness whence energies erupt or surface, and the sure “self” is no master but a derivative
therefrom. In a sense, these depths are more intimate with the mystery of the givenness
of being in the primal ethos. Perhaps, then, autonomy is less the sovereign it takes itself
to be as the dark issue of an origin more enigmatic than its own self-determining powers.
Autonomy as self-transcendence opens into transcendence beyond autonomy – opens
into, because it opens up out of this more mysterious other transcendence.
There is a dialectical lesson here, rather a double dialectical lesson. First autonomy
as self-transcendence only seems to solve the antinomy and dialectically overcome the
tension of autonomy and transcendence, and indeed surmount every need for reference
to a “beyond.” This is the first dialectic. But there is a kind of doppelgänger dialectic
behind or beyond this. There is an other otherness beyond the seemingly dialectically
overcome otherness. Immanent exploration of autonomy as self-transcendence shows
the self to be the issue of a transcending source not itself self-transcendence. Our selftranscending is first energized by the given endowment of the passio essendi, and only
then by the endeavor of the conatus essendi. Self-transcendence is not made possible by
an autonomous self, but the transcendence of the autonomous self is made possible by
transcendence as other to self-transcendence. This other transcendence brings us back
into the neighborhood of perplexity about God.
This last point is not often granted. If the other origin is granted at all, and if there is any
breakthrough into the energies of the primal ethos, it tends to be in terms of the occlusion
already pervasively at work in the reconfigured ethos. I mean that the devaluation of being
produces further results here, both in thinking of human self-transcendence and thinking of
the origin as other. The latter is seen in terms of what I will call the dark origin; the former
is often understood as some variation of will to power.
4 To these two points in turn.
DARK ORIGINS AND TRANSCENDENCE AS OTHER
What I mean by “the dark origin” concerns, first, the continued exigence for transcendence as other, even in devalued being, and second, a view of this transcendence that, nevertheless, perpetuates a reflection of the reconfigured ethos of worthless being – “worthless”
sometimes in the sense of being merely neutral, other times in the presentiment of its being
4
 My points of reference here include Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, as well as Hegel, Kant, and others,
and you might say “Surely these thinkers are behind us?” Yet Nietzsche brings something to a head
that has not yet had its adequate response. What he uttered was in formation through those who
came before him. We still live in the shadow of these thinkers, and how they found themselves in the
antinomy of autonomy and transcendence. 
GODLESSNESS AND THE ETHOS OF BEING 25
hostile to us, perhaps even evil. Still we cannot but ask about the ground or origin of that
valueless middle: What is ultimate, what is being ultimately, at bottom, or in origin? Above
the reply was heard: there is no ultimate good in the end. Now we hear: there is no good
at all in the beginning.
Undoubtedly, we are always tempted to define the ultimate relative to our being in the
middle: we reconfigure the primal ethos in terms of ourselves. If we see the middle as
worthless, it is hard not to think of the origin/ultimate as also worthless. You interject,
benignly, “the middle as valueless is there, indifferently there, neutral: neither good nor
evil.” I hear you. But can we maintain this stance, finally? For in the middle we twist in
the tension of plurality, racked by strains between us and ourselves, between humans,
between humans and other beings of nature, between beings in nature other than us.
“Nature red in tooth and claw” is hard to blink away, despite all precautions of agnostic
indifferentism. Homo homini lupus, no honest person can deny, despite all quarantines
of studied neutralism. In truth, no immunization from value is effective finally. Any
agnostic indifferentism seems only a way station along a slippery path from the worthless middle to the worthless origin. More, any suggestion that the origin might be good
becomes incredible to those gliding along the frictionless pathway of ontological neutralization. And it is not that we fail, that we cannot live the truth of a “neutral” world. That
is true but not the main point. We cannot live it, because to live always shows the truth
of the value of life. Valueless neutrality is impossible because there lives no such thing. Its
truth is death. And perhaps not even death, since there is nothing neutral about death.
The point could be elaborated relative to the longer arc of modernity, for the turning
of this arc from its upward motion to its downward spiral can be shown in nuce in the
transition from Hegel to Schopenhauer. It is not incidental that Hegel’s Science of Logic
(1812–16) was written at almost exactly the same time as Schopenhauer’s World as Will
and Representation (Vol. I, 1818). We fail to take much notice of this, perhaps because
Schopenhauer only exerted influence well after Hegel’s death. And yet the Hegelian hymn
to ascendant reason is contemporaneous with the Schopenhauerian descent into a more
ultimate darkness prior to reason. Can the ascent of one be divorced from the descent of
the other? Do we not still live out of the consequences of that ascent and descent?
Hegel might be seen as the epitome, the consummation of the upward movement of
modern self-determination from its first primitive expression to an extraordinarily complex dialectical determination. To be absolute is to be self-determining. I have given
many essential qualifications elsewhere (e.g., Hegel’s God), but Hegel’s absolute is identified with the free self-realization of reason itself: the origin becomes itself fully by overcoming the indefiniteness of the beginning, becomes thus completely self-mediating and
self-fulfilled. Hegel is one of the major philosophers in modernity who struggled against
devalued being (he might not put it thus); but equivocities in his dialectic, with respect to
self-determining being and relative to otherness, issue in both a claim to the completion
of self-determining being, and the dialectical reversal of that completion.
The following is one way I would put it (there are others): thought thinking itself is reversed
into thought thinking what is other to thought. The difficult question is: What is this other?
There have been different responses, and the matter is still deeply in question. Schopenhauer
reveals something about the reversal, though, oddly enough, it is already prepared in Kant,
unbeknown to Kant himself. Reason becomes the bright side of a more basic energy of being
other to reason; indeed, in the present instance, other in a way that turns reason into an
instrument or means. Reason becomes the slave of will – not sovereign master but a tool. It
can be both a weapon of the will identified with the dark origin, and a protection for humans
against this very darkness. Schopenhauer’s will is a blind, insatiable striving, a dark version
of an erotic absolute; Hegel’s Geist, or Idea, is a bright rational version of the erotic absolute
(see BB, pp. 242–51, 260–1; PU, pp. 238–51). Could one venture that, after Hegel, the erotics of being present themselves more and more in the form of eros turranos?

Press, 1967), p. 253; also pp. 68, 251, 268; Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology [1929],
26 GODLESSNESS
Schopenhauer explicitly stylizes himself as an “atheist,” contemptuous of the moral
God (Hegel and Nietzsche share something of this contempt). Nevertheless, Schopenhauer
has his “god,” though this god looks more like Descartes’ evil genius than any benevolent Providence. Hegel too has his “atheist” side, detected by Kierkegaard, enacted by
Feuerbach and Marx, and other left-Hegelian spawn. A lesson I take from this: the question of God and atheism is not amenable to simple oppositional categories, despite the
polemical crudities of some of Hegel’s successors. This is the main point here: there is
something ironical, in an entirely just respect, in the emergence of the dark origin against
the horizon of the consummate self-determining rational origin in Hegel. The dream
of this idealistic origin begins to bring forth monsters. The human being also becomes
hard to see as more than a puppet of this dark origin. We witness the beginnings of the
decomposition of the “god” autonomy. More, we see the eruption of dark transcendence
in human self-transcendence, and yet this darkness tells of a deeper, unfathomable darkness that is other to human self-transcendence.
Here begins the downward movement of the arc of self-determining being. It is foolish
to think the question of God is finished because of the rash of “announcements” in recent
centuries of humankind being beyond religion or God. The downward movement brings
us to this point about will to power. We come to think of ourselves in the image of the
origin, as well as the origin in our own image. For we are originals, are we not? What does
this mean? It means we are sources of origination that instantiate the original power of
the ultimate source. If the latter is will, other to thought thinking itself, we too are will, or
more affirmatively, will to power. This resort to will to power unfolds rather than transforms the basic ontological attitude governing the situation. And so to the second point.

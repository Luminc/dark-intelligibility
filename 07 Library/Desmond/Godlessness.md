Chapter 1
Godlessness and the Ethos of Being
They overlay the land
The locusts of development
Lay their eggs of promise
& hatch the larvae
Of meaninglessness
We have wiped out the line
& the horizon now is
Between us and nothing
Nothing
Except ourselves
We think
The light in between
We do not see it
We look on what is below
The sun is always above
It casts no shadow
We never see it
We face only forward
Nothing but ourselves
Before us
Our faces fl at
Towards the future
GODLESSNESS
There is no question more ultimate than the question of the ultimate. This is the question of God. Non-philosophers may well be willing to grant this claim. They may even
expect philosophers to come to their assistance. But we philosophers have long listened
to the voices of suspicion, voices that when they do not make us hostile to the question,
paralyze our thinking on the ultimate. We have become embarrassed by the question.
This is something astonishing. The most important question, the most fascinating
question, the most enigmatic question, makes us squirm – squirm though we wear the
unmoved mask of agnostic indifference. How make sense of this shame? Can we mark
some of the way stations on this path of shame? And when we have passed along it, can
we then ask: What then?
We in the West are heirs of a number of religious traditions, but as descendants we
have turned our inheritance into hostility to itself. We emerge from religious traditions,
notably the Jewish and Christian, but certain developments of just those traditions have
made trouble for any untroubled living of those traditions. I mean that certain forms of
theism are not to be absolved from atheisms that seem to be their opposite. Godlessness
emerges from our being in relation to God. We think of ourselves as at the end of a
“good” progress, even when we debunk progress. We are enlightened even when we
pour scorn on Enlightenment. We see our scorn as our light – but suppose we are freaks.
How freaks? Freaks because the natural condition is to be religious: it is unnatural to be
atheist. This crime against nature arises from nature as we interpret it.
We open our eyes, we smell, we breathe, we touch, we are touched, by rock, by the
satin of a flower petal, by skin. We are amazed, even delighted, we attend on a certain
music of things. When much seems rough and repulsive our horror is the shadow of our
astonishment. What is strangely there is strange because it intimates an other – in and
through its very own otherness. There is no shadow of a question, yet: the divine is there,
though there as also not there, for there is nothing to which one could point univocally
and say: That is God. But what that means one does not know.
Or say, one hears one’s breath, in the quiet of sitting still, or in trepidation as if trailed,
and one hears oneself in an intimacy idiotic to every conceptual objectification, and one
does not know what the soul is, beyond knowing that one does not know. There is hinted
a depth to selving beyond self, and the haunting of self by an other that slows one into
uncertain expectancy. Is this then our being, this uncertain expectancy? But we do not
yet know what this means.
Or again, another stirs delight and disquiet in us. We behold a beautiful boy or girl,
woman or man, and the beauty can lift one up unbidden and yet also be unbearable,
almost. It flows over one, and away from one, though one reaches to it, but it is always
in excess, and gone. It comes forward to meet one, and yet is fugitive in its forwardness.
A gift has been offered; it seems everywhere and nowhere; and one might be surprised
into asking: Is this gift a sacramental sign? But what this all means, one does not know,
and perhaps may never know.
But – knowing or not-knowing – there is nothing contrived about the question of
God. It is elemental and enigmatic – elemental because of the givenness of self, other,
nature; enigmatic because one is struck into an as-yet-uncomprehended astonishment
by the givenness. The astonishing gift perplexes us about what offers it, or who. And
our question is not something to which history determines us, even when it is historically mediated. It is not something grammar imposes on us, even when our speaking is
grammatically conditioned. It is not the sly unconscious that presses it on us, though its
roots go down deeper than the conscious or unconscious. It is not something to which
our social status condemns us. It is not something insidious metaphysics imposes on
us, though we cannot escape metaphysics, twist and turn as we will. The question is
elemental and inescapable. But we have to be with the elemental, and face what cannot
be evaded, to know what this means. Nor will we “overcome” the question, when we
have baptized our chains as historicist chains, grammatological, psychoanalytical, sociopolitical, philosophical chains. There are other fetters, harder to unbind, for instance, the
lie in the soul, not to mention vices not always dignified with names in philosophy.
Why has the face of being come for many to seem void of communication of God, when
everything within and without seems to press on us the question? The changed attitude
to being marking modernity has much to do with the matter. This has been recognized
by many, and with many different emphases.1
 My emphasis falls on our reconfiguration
of the primal ethos along a particular line of response to the equivocity of givenness. This
produces a certain devaluation of being stripped of signs suggestive of divine transcendence. This is coupled with a culture of autonomy which, tempted to absolutize itself,
eclipses transcendence as other, though behind the mask of autonomy is a will to power
usurping absoluteness in a world said to be void of absolutes. The specter of nihilism, now
expressed, now recessed, in which all other-being is instrumentalized haunts our claim to
mastery, finally inverting into an outcome in which it all seems to come to nothing.
Suppose one holds to a God the creator of all, a God other than creation. Suppose,
further, that the creation is given its own being for itself – given to be, it yet has its own
otherness. Suppose God is other yet intimate, and other with an unsurpassable transcendence that nothing finite in creation can match. Suppose we seek to relate genuinely to
this transcendence. If the transcendence is absolute, the search seems futile. If the search
augurs of success, the transcendence seems not absolute. What then are the options? If
we say the transcendence is absolute, we drive God away from us into a beyond, and
our futility is just our search itself: the search drives away from itself what it seems to
be driving towards, and hence lacks the basis to yield even a half success. Better then to
search by not searching at all? If to seek God is to drive God away, cease to search, and

 For example, the progress of the more exact sciences, the increase in technological control over the
conditions of life, the secularization of everyday life, the alleged maturing of rational humanity, human
self-responsibility, or perhaps the refusal of given nature, or self-intoxicated will to power, and so on.
All these have their truth, but we must still pitch the question at the level of what it means to be.
18 GODLESSNESS
let God come towards one. But if no God seems to come? Let us wait. How long must we
wait? Since we wait for eternity, must we wait for an eternity? But we grow restless and
impatient. We have waited and nothing seems to come. Or perhaps it came but we did
not see it pass? And perhaps it is there, and there is no wait, only the call of transformation? We have waited, and still wait, and no God seems to come. What then? Why then
transcendence seems to turn over into immanence: first, immanence grieving over its own
failure of self-surpassing; then immanence hostile over its previous desire for God; then
immanence hostile to God as depriving its own self-surpassing of its own esteem in itself;
finally, immanence as willing the immanent esteem of its own worldly self-transcendence.
And then there is no more waiting and expectancy. We have arrived – God has arrived.
Transcendence overturned. We–God–Ourselves.
If thought is too condensed in these statements, I will thin things in the sequel. To
round off this opening sortie: We search other-being as outer – nature’s astonishing
thereness. We search other-being as inner – the enigmatic abyss of our own selving.
Each of these teases us into thought of God. (Kant: the starry sky above, the moral law
within.) And yet God is other to both. But what if we conceive of divine transcendence in
dualistic terms, as can easily happen? Then no community seems possible between God
and creation. Not only does it seem that God withdraws into self-sufficient independence; world and we can seem to do so too. Or it might seem as if the flood tide of the
divine ebbs, and world and we find ourselves beached on the solitude of a Godless shore.
Something like this ebb of the great tide seems to occur in modernity.
What causes the ebb is very perplexing. Is it the self-withdrawal of God, as some have
thought? Or was that space of transcendence always empty? Or have we, in a series of
slight shifts – slight as singular, but momentous as a continuing series – blinded ourselves,
deafened ourselves, numbed ourselves, though we call our sightlessness, our silence, our
anesthesia enlightened? Something of the latter, I think, though I think so as one hard
of hearing and as squinting. Yet, given the mystery of God, and the potential for equivocity in our openness to communication, there is some truth to the first suggestion.
Our reconfiguration of the primal ethos produces a second ethos, and this makes more
difficult our attunement to the signs of the divine. We can see this relative to the ebb:
First relative to other-being as outer; then relative to other-being as inner. I mean, first,
the desacralizing effects of the devaluation of being in modernity; I mean, second, the
atheistic consequences of the self-assertion of human self-transcendence and its idolization of autonomy. In turning now to these points, our concern is the muffling of the signs
communicating the divine in the ethos of being, a muffling our reconfiguration effects.
At the ultimate, all this comes to nothing. In the chapter to follow, a reborn mindfulness
of those signs, a mindfulness born out of the return to zero, will be at issue.
DEVALUED BEING: THE STRIPPING OF THE SIGNS
The sources of the question of God are many, but major sources occur in astonishment and
perplexity: astonishment before the sheer givenness of being; perplexity about the intelligibility, the meaning, indeed goodness of that given being. The astonishment is a beginning
that is overdetermined, in excess of all determinacy. The perplexity follows the beginning
in being a troubled thought about intelligibility, meaning, worth; it begins a move from
the overdetermined givenness to a more determinate articulation for us. This perplexity, in
turn, begets definite curiosity about the processes at work in the givenness. Out of curiosity
the determinate cognitions of science emerge, and with a definite drift towards the utmost
possible univocity in our articulation of intelligibility. (I say nothing yet about the urge to
use the givenness, to exploit it for our own desires.) This movement from astonishment to
perplexity to definite curiosity shows the transcending power of our mindfulness, but it can
be fatal with equivocation relative to God. For the question of God does not arise in the
determinate cognition of a definite matter of fact about which we are curious. It concerns
more our metaphysical astonishment before the givenness of the being-there of being, also
our perplexity as to what it might all mean, in relation to origin and end, what the point
GODLESSNESS AND THE ETHOS OF BEING 19
of it all is in relation to its worthiness to be affirmed as good. The beginning, as indeed the
end, is in excess of every curiosity and every determinate cognition.
The question of God precedes science, outlives it, but also always shadows it. It exceeds
the will to complete determination that marks the move of curiosity to definite answers.
Its excess is not that of an emotional murk that surrounds, like a penumbra, the clear
light of our cognition. It bears on a mindfulness impossible to capture completely in the
determinate categories of a definite cognition. This mode of mindfulness has not been
well respected in modernity, and now is less and less spontaneously understood. Why?
Because the momentum of modernity dominantly conceives our development as away
from astonishment and perplexity towards as definite a determinate cognition as possible. Even if wonder, astonishment, perplexity are granted in the beginning, these are to
be dispelled once the proper unfolding of mind is effected. The former are merely indefinite, and our task is to make things as definite as possible, that is, to conquer completely
the putative indefiniteness of the beginning. We may even erect this into a historical destiny: religion for the primitives or children; metaphysics for the rationalistic adolescents;
science for the adults come of age. And, of course, we are the grown-ups – enlightened,
post-Comtean adults. For us, no more religion or metaphysics.
This claim to maturity, one suspects, is rife with misunderstanding, and misunderstanding derived, ironically, from a surfeit of cleverness. For this surfeit of cleverness
is accompanied by an enfeebling of astonishment and an irritability with perplexity,
especially metaphysical perplexity. The latter resists encapsulation in definite conceptualizations and hence chastens our intellectual self-esteem. Impatience with this resistance,
irritation with intractable perplexity, these issue in an unprecedented will to univocalize
being, a will that also makes being God-forsaken. But this is not evident at first.
The will to univocalize being is manifest in the project to mathematicize nature such as
we find in Galileo, Descartes, and others. My interest is the changed attitude to being in
this reconfiguration of the primal ethos. Most important is the loss of intimacy between
being and the good, an intimacy witnessed to in a variety of ways in the premodern ethos.
In the modern reconfiguration there comes to be a separation of being and the good. For
the good is enigmatic and resistant to complete objectification and determination; it poses
challenges to the univocalizing mind that this mind cannot fully meet. The premodern sense
of the good was often identified with the end, in Aristotle and others, but the end is not univocally determinable. Even less is it possible to subject it to mathematical measure. To the
univocalizing mind this is not satisfactory, and so this good is called into question, indeed
put out of question, by being denied any place in explanatory schemes of intelligibility.
Excise thus the good and what results? We find ourselves in the between, which is
now the ongoingness of process without end: a purposeless between, unless perhaps we
reconstruct ourselves as purposing in the face of the purposelessness of other-being. The
beginning is not good either; it is efficient cause reduced to the mechanism of effecting
a happening. The mechanical effecting happens; it has no purpose; it has no good; it is
valueless happening. And our condition? Between a worthless beginning and a purposeless end, without end; in a middle that in itself has no worth or inherent end. Upshot: the
devaluation of being. Being is in itself worthless. It is there, yes; it is a happening, yes.
Does it have value in itself, is its being a good in itself? Such questions should arise but
do not properly. Univocalizing mind issues in the devaluation of being.
Can one find signs of God in being thus devalued? Very hard. It is not that efforts were
not made; by Pascal, for instance, by Descartes, by many others. The efforts often have a
taint of artificiality and strain; they lack the tang of the elemental. It is as if the devalued
milieu forces us to more and more twisted ways of finding a way back into the proximity of
the divine, and none quite works. Then there comes a point when the atheism of devalued
being comes to seem elementally self-evident. The twisting and turning is given up; but
so also is the mystery of God. Our question then: Are we true to being in devaluing it?
Is being as devalued true to being? If not, do we not have to find a different way? Of what is
devalued being itself a sign? Nothing, it seems. The outcome seems nihilism. Does the issue,
then, become, at least in part, one of a “revaluation” of being, at least in the sense of some
20 GODLESSNESS
GODLESSNESS AND THE ETHOS OF BEING 21
restoration of other-being as other, and its inherent worthiness to be affirmed as, in some
enigmatic sense, good? If so, would perplexity about God again flare up with passion?

IDOLIZED AUTONOMY: ECLIPSE OF TRANSCENDENCE AS OTHER
Devalued being is not the end of the matter. When we take into account our own being,
the changed attitude also affects us. Just as the givenness of other-being in nature is
stripped of the signs of qualitative worth, so also we assume an analogous relation to
our own being given to be. For we are given to be before we give ourselves to be. There
is a passio essendi, a patience of being, more primordial than our conatus essendi, our
endeavor to be. This patience is intimately connected with our porosity to the divine, for
we are first as having received our being rather than as having determined it for ourselves,
through ourselves. The passio essendi is closer to the more ultimate energizing source of
our conatus essendi but it also defines the vulnerability of our finitude. This vulnerability
may seem exacerbated, if the ethos of other-being is valueless in itself; in fact, our conatus
essendi seems rather spurred into an activism, a self-activation that can lead even to an
extreme of hyper-activism. Then the passio essendi is forced into recess as the conatus
essendi, expressing itself without hindrance, goes into overdrive. The patience of being is
overridden in this overdrive of the endeavor to be, so overridden that the porosity to the
divine constituting our being religious falls out of focus.
In the reconfigured ethos of devalued being, we find ourselves between a worthless
beginning and a valueless, endless end. Nevertheless, in the middle we determine a relation to things. Our relativity is not neutral but charged with value. Even if other-being
is valueless, we cannot be but as valuing being, again even if the value thus unavoidable
is value for us. There’s the rub. If we value other-being as for us, can we finally avoid a
slide from valueless being into being as instrumentalized? Being is a means to an end; and
what is the end? We are the end. Why? Because one necessity we cannot negate is that
we are oriented to an end, some end, any end. Nietzsche hits the bull (albeit for different
purposes than ours): man would rather will nothingness than not will.
We cannot be but valuing being; we cannot will not to be willing beings; for not willing
or willing nothing is still willing. The question is what to will; and indeed how to will.
What is the implicit sense of being that determines our relation to other-being, and the
sense of our own being as willing? In the context of valueless being, being as a whole
cannot escape its demotion to being instrumentalized. But is this not finally true of us
also? We may assert ourselves as the power wielding the instrument, but the other we
instrumentalize will finally be not only nature but human being itself. The end: ontological tyranny on ourselves. I will come to this, for at first the exact opposite seems the
truth: namely, that now we are truly released into our own original freedom. As it turns
out, the freedom is at best equivocal, at worst delusionary and megalomaniac.
How dare one say this? Do we not live in the epoch of freedom? And was not Hegel
at least right about this, though his critics will begrudge him? Let freedom ring!
Unhesitatingly, we fall prostrate before this god. But is the prostration not in collusion
with the devaluation? For the univocalizing of other-being wills to make being completely determinate, with the loss of inherent value, and so it prepares an empty space for
us as its proper users. It makes straight the way for our determining power as the sole
source of value. And so we are a determining origin that passes into and through otherbeing as a means to itself as the true end. Other-being becomes the medium of our own
self-determination. This tends to be the dominant logic of modern freedom, and not in
any merely negative sense of freedom from external restraint. There is that, but there is
more, namely our freedom to become the power of being we are already in promise. It
may take centuries to unfold the implications of these views.
My point is not to deny freedom, but to question any absolutizing of autonomy as the
fullest truth of freedom. Modernity exhibits the self-assertion of autonomy: determination
comes to mean our power to determine other-being, so that in the medium of other-being,
22 GODLESSNESS
determination is self-determination. What is the problem then? The recession of the patience
of being, and the reconfiguration, to the point of distortion, of the essential relation to otherbeing. Other-being serves as the medium of our self-determining: we mediate with otherbeing because we finally want to mediate with ourselves. We also do not do justice to the
intimate otherness of our own passio essendi. Self-determination can become a kind of idol,
so enchanting to our self-understanding we do not see the equivocal relation to the other
it generates. The other may be a means to further freedom or a possible threat, but if the
primary stress is on autonomy, the other will always be secondary, serving for the self. The
idol: autonomy as a nomos of to auto subjecting to heteros to its law. Not only nature, but
God and other humans carry the insinuations of threats to the auto, and so their otherness
as other has to be “overcome.” Of course, if my autonomy must coexist with the justified
autonomy of the other, then autonomy cannot be absolutized. We have to rethink freedom
outside of the hegemony of autonomy (see EB, passim on this). This also means revisiting
both our own intimate otherness and God’s.
The ontological danger here is that we idolize ourselves and think it our destiny to create the world anew in our image. This project of the will to power is the open secret of
modernity. It is an ontological necessity that human beings be will to power if being as
such is valueless. It has no good, it is no good, it is worthless; we cannot live with this; we
must hence make it worthy. Worthy of what? Worthy of itself, worthy of God? Rather,
worthy of ourselves. We are original, we are the power. And the goal? What could be
the point of it all? We are not given the point; we make the point; we will the point to be
ourselves. So we say. And the other? The point of the other must be the self. But what is
the point of the self when the self is just for itself, and the other is for the self? Finally, no
point at all, and the outcome is nihilism. We will come again to this.

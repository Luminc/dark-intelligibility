We are the struggle between consent and refusal, and not consent to this or
that, or refusal of this or that, but rather consent as an overdeterminate trust in the basic
goodness of being, or refusal as an indeterminate negation of, and dissent from, being as
good at bottom. The mystery of God manifested in the shock of evil makes of the equivocity of being a darkness against which we may rage, or in which may dawn on us the
consent to live uncertainly. These two are faithlessness and faith, and each is equivocal.
For the first is defined over against the second, as the second is gained, sustained only in
the face of the first. With us they are like Siamese twins, sometimes joined at the head,
sometimes the flesh, always in the heart itself, and perhaps in death only do they part.
For when they are parted, that is the moment of our death – and perhaps true life.

 I mean:
our second “yes” may appear to be true to the first “yes,” but it is feigned. A feigned
affirmation says “yes” but does not say “yes.”

p. 35

Having lived thus and thus one just is that false
skin. To strip it away will feel like being flayed. We may need the discipline of a new asceticism: an aske
-sis that is a “no” seeking to waken again the elemental “yes” that endows and
blesses us. Any violence here, of course, is fraught with ambiguity, indeed danger. The stripping that claims to purify might secretly derive from the indeterminate negation rather than
the elemental “yes.” We are a mingling of opposites, and great discernment is needed to sift
them. There is an asceticism of hatred; there is a purging of love; and hatred may speak the
language of love. To see the difference we need love, but love may be what we most lack.

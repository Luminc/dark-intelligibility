We are the struggle between consent and refusal, and not consent to this or
that, or refusal of this or that, but rather consent as an overdeterminate trust in the basic
goodness of being, or refusal as an indeterminate negation of, and dissent from, being as
good at bottom. The mystery of God manifested in the shock of evil makes of the equivocity of being a darkness against which we may rage, or in which may dawn on us the
consent to live uncertainly. These two are faithlessness and faith, and each is equivocal.
For the first is defined over against the second, as the second is gained, sustained only in
the face of the first. With us they are like Siamese twins, sometimes joined at the head,
sometimes the flesh, always in the heart itself, and perhaps in death only do they part.
For when they are parted, that is the moment of our death – and perhaps true life.

 I mean:
our second “yes” may appear to be true to the first “yes,” but it is feigned. A feigned
affirmation says “yes” but does not say “yes.”

p. 35

Having lived thus and thus one just is that false
skin. To strip it away will feel like being flayed. We may need the discipline of a new asceticism: an aske
-sis that is a “no” seeking to waken again the elemental “yes” that endows and
blesses us. Any violence here, of course, is fraught with ambiguity, indeed danger. The stripping that claims to purify might secretly derive from the indeterminate negation rather than
the elemental “yes.” We are a mingling of opposites, and great discernment is needed to sift
them. There is an asceticism of hatred; there is a purging of love; and hatred may speak the
language of love. To see the difference we need love, but love may be what we most lack. 

p.36

The return to zero restores us to a condition of ontological vulnerability in which we are confronted with an “either/or” between an elemental “yes” or “no.” I recall that the Hermes figure – Terminus in Rome – was a boundary stone marking the space between the living and the dead. I further recall that Heraclitus said that Dionysus is also Hades (Frag. 15). The return to zero puts us in a place that is noplace. There is no “bottom”; nevertheless, we have reached “bottom” in the ordeal. And yet: though coming to nothing, we are not nothing. Though we might feel we are as nothing, nevertheless we still participate in an elemental affirmation of being at all, in that we continue to be. As being at all, we are already an affirmation of the good of the “to be” – even in the return to zero, it is good to be. For we are first an ontological “yes” – this surges in and through us in the passio essendi. But we are confronted with a further “either/or”: either “yes” or “no” in an elemental sense to being and the good of the “to be” in its worthiness to be affirmed or refused. If we say “no,” we may go under into despair. If we say “yes,” the “yes” is not determined by anything other than the rightness of the “yes,” and its fidelity to the given passio essendi. By virtue of the latter we are already participants in a primal affirmation of the good of the “to be” – ontologically we are the living of this affirmation before we know of it, and live it more mindfully. We can live in express refusal of this prior living “yes.” If here there is a second “yes” to the first “yes,” it is the mindful springing up again of the affirming energy of being, in our porosity to what is beyond us, and in the finite rapport of self-being and other-being. There is no argument for the first living of the ontological “yes”; it is a happening.

p.35

Is there a love marking our being religious that is erotic? Much depends on recognizing the more primal affirmative energy of being that cannot be fully described in terms
of lack. I relate eros to the porosity of our being.5
 As there is a poverty that is no mere
indigence, so eros is more than lacking. Recall Diotima’s myth in the Symposium concerning the double parentage of eros in penia and poros. We often focus on penia as
lack; less often do we foreground the “resource” of poros. I relate this “poros” to the
porosity of our being. Is there a resource of poros intimately related to the porosity at
the root of our being religious, a resource in lacking itself that is not just an expression
of negative energy but intimately connected with porosity? Poros has connotations of
a “way across.” With no way across or through, we are at an impasse, an aporia. By
contrast, porosity enables a passage through or across. It is something that is not any
one thing; it is more like a medium enabling a flow of energy, an energy itself no thing
since it passes or is communicated from one thing to another. Poros names the making
of a way. It names a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way
and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way. We cannot determinately
fix the passage, or passing through, to this or that finite thing, and so it seems nothing.
In another sense it is not at all nothing: it enables a way being made, a making way, an
original coming to be. In some such wise, the between is constituted as a space of primal
porosity, and every being within it participates in this porosity after its own kind. In our
return to zero, we become intimate again with this gifted poverty, and in the elemental
eros of our being. To become mindful of the porosity is to come closer to the primal
ethos, though neither porosity nor ethos can be approached in a univocally direct way.

p.41


We divine the doubleness as not only our own immanent
duality, but as intimating the absolved relativity of our transcending to transcendence as
other. And this, whether we are oriented beyond our present limited form, or returned
more intensively into our own original ground. The immanent equivocity of our intimate being is a plurivocal sign of an immanent community of human self-transcendence
and transcendence as other; an immanent community that can never be reduced just
to immanence. In the inner equivocity of our own immanent selving we find ourselves
awakening to what is beyond ourselves, awakening in the communication of the intimate
universal. 

p.143

Through this second intermediation, not to be reduced to the primal
immanent divine intermediation, the agapeic origin brings to be the absolved relativity
in which the finite between is originated and let to be. This second intermediating would
not first be constituted by the already existent being of finitude. It would be a creating intermediation that brings into being the finite creation as other. This coming to be
(understood as an agapeic origination) would be a coming to be of finitude as genuinely
other to the origin. This would express, if you like, the divine poiesis, the creating art of
God. But this creating art is not creating God, it is God creating finite creation as other.

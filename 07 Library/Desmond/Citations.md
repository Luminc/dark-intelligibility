We are the struggle between consent and refusal, and not consent to this or
that, or refusal of this or that, but rather consent as an overdeterminate trust in the basic
goodness of being, or refusal as an indeterminate negation of, and dissent from, being as
good at bottom. The mystery of God manifested in the shock of evil makes of the equivocity of being a darkness against which we may rage, or in which may dawn on us the
consent to live uncertainly. These two are faithlessness and faith, and each is equivocal.
For the first is defined over against the second, as the second is gained, sustained only in
the face of the first. With us they are like Siamese twins, sometimes joined at the head,
sometimes the flesh, always in the heart itself, and perhaps in death only do they part.
For when they are parted, that is the moment of our death – and perhaps true life.

 I mean:
our second “yes” may appear to be true to the first “yes,” but it is feigned. A feigned
affirmation says “yes” but does not say “yes.”

p. 35

Having lived thus and thus one just is that false
skin. To strip it away will feel like being flayed. We may need the discipline of a new asceticism: an aske
-sis that is a “no” seeking to waken again the elemental “yes” that endows and
blesses us. Any violence here, of course, is fraught with ambiguity, indeed danger. The stripping that claims to purify might secretly derive from the indeterminate negation rather than
the elemental “yes.” We are a mingling of opposites, and great discernment is needed to sift
them. There is an asceticism of hatred; there is a purging of love; and hatred may speak the
language of love. To see the difference we need love, but love may be what we most lack. 

p.36

The return to zero restores us to a condition of ontological vulnerability in which we are confronted with an “either/or” between an elemental “yes” or “no.” I recall that the Hermes figure – Terminus in Rome – was a boundary stone marking the space between the living and the dead. I further recall that Heraclitus said that Dionysus is also Hades (Frag. 15). The return to zero puts us in a place that is noplace. There is no “bottom”; nevertheless, we have reached “bottom” in the ordeal. And yet: though coming to nothing, we are not nothing. Though we might feel we are as nothing, nevertheless we still participate in an elemental affirmation of being at all, in that we continue to be. As being at all, we are already an affirmation of the good of the “to be” – even in the return to zero, it is good to be. For we are first an ontological “yes” – this surges in and through us in the passio essendi. But we are confronted with a further “either/or”: either “yes” or “no” in an elemental sense to being and the good of the “to be” in its worthiness to be affirmed or refused. If we say “no,” we may go under into despair. If we say “yes,” the “yes” is not determined by anything other than the rightness of the “yes,” and its fidelity to the given passio essendi. By virtue of the latter we are already participants in a primal affirmation of the good of the “to be” – ontologically we are the living of this affirmation before we know of it, and live it more mindfully. We can live in express refusal of this prior living “yes.” If here there is a second “yes” to the first “yes,” it is the mindful springing up again of the affirming energy of being, in our porosity to what is beyond us, and in the finite rapport of self-being and other-being. There is no argument for the first living of the ontological “yes”; it is a happening.

p.35

Is there a love marking our being religious that is erotic? Much depends on recognizing the more primal affirmative energy of being that cannot be fully described in terms
of lack. I relate eros to the porosity of our being.5
 As there is a poverty that is no mere
indigence, so eros is more than lacking. Recall Diotima’s myth in the Symposium concerning the double parentage of eros in penia and poros. We often focus on penia as
lack; less often do we foreground the “resource” of poros. I relate this “poros” to the
porosity of our being. Is there a resource of poros intimately related to the porosity at
the root of our being religious, a resource in lacking itself that is not just an expression
of negative energy but intimately connected with porosity? Poros has connotations of
a “way across.” With no way across or through, we are at an impasse, an aporia. By
contrast, porosity enables a passage through or across. It is something that is not any
one thing; it is more like a medium enabling a flow of energy, an energy itself no thing
since it passes or is communicated from one thing to another. Poros names the making
of a way. It names a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way
and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way. We cannot determinately
fix the passage, or passing through, to this or that finite thing, and so it seems nothing.
In another sense it is not at all nothing: it enables a way being made, a making way, an
original coming to be. In some such wise, the between is constituted as a space of primal
porosity, and every being within it participates in this porosity after its own kind. In our
return to zero, we become intimate again with this gifted poverty, and in the elemental
eros of our being. To become mindful of the porosity is to come closer to the primal
ethos, though neither porosity nor ethos can be approached in a univocally direct way.

p.41


We divine the doubleness as not only our own immanent
duality, but as intimating the absolved relativity of our transcending to transcendence as
other. And this, whether we are oriented beyond our present limited form, or returned
more intensively into our own original ground. The immanent equivocity of our intimate being is a plurivocal sign of an immanent community of human self-transcendence
and transcendence as other; an immanent community that can never be reduced just
to immanence. In the inner equivocity of our own immanent selving we find ourselves
awakening to what is beyond ourselves, awakening in the communication of the intimate
universal. 

p.143

Through this second intermediation, not to be reduced to the primal
immanent divine intermediation, the agapeic origin brings to be the absolved relativity
in which the finite between is originated and let to be. This second intermediating would
not first be constituted by the already existent being of finitude. It would be a creating intermediation that brings into being the finite creation as other. This coming to be
(understood as an agapeic origination) would be a coming to be of finitude as genuinely
other to the origin. This would express, if you like, the divine poiesis, the creating art of
God. But this creating art is not creating God, it is God creating finite creation as other.

### p.129 - USED AS CH. 01 EPIGRAPH - Proceed/Recede Paradox
Self, other, non-human nature can strike one as receding from complete determination, even as they come forward into determinate manifestation. As beings proceed, they recede; as they show themselves, they reserve themselves; as they manifest themselves, they hide their being.

We are here on the boundary of determinate intelligibility, but this idiocy of the "that it is" directs us to the living ground of communicative being, as centered in this being.

### p.15 (approx) - The Between as Ontological Ethos
There is first the ontological ethos of what I call the between. We are in this intermedium of being and our participation in it contributes to shaping the form it takes for us. Our participation contributes to a second ethos which is the reconfigured ethos.

p.15

### p.15 (approx) - The Ethos of the Between is Primordial
The ethos of the between, the given milieu of being is the more primordial. The ways we construct formulate more definite passages of existing and thinking in and out of this first ethos. The ethos seems to be indefinite, since it is not this determinate thing or happening or that, and so cannot be definitively pinned down. It is the enabling milieu without which there would not be this or that determinate process or thing.

### p.16 (approx) - Astonishment Breaking Through
Now and then, in moments of astonishment and perplexity, an intimation of this first ethos may break through, and the second ethos takes on a new light of strangeness. Briefly, it seems other, and seems to show something other. Too briefly, for soon the more familiar second ethos reassumes its more domestic sway over us, and our readiness for mystery and strangeness falls asleep again. It seems to me that if we are to find true ways to God anew, we must be awoken from this sleep.

### p.27 (approx) - Original Porosity
We are marked by an original porosity which opens us to all that is other and that marks us with the passion of being, the passio essendi. One might say: Without religious poetics, no systematics. And: Without a more original porosity of being, and our given passio essendi, no religious poetics either, and hence also no systematics. This means there is a more original sense of being religious prior to being artistic and being philosophical. Poetics and systematics are ultimately less original than the porosity of...

### p.30 (approx) - Elemental and Enigmatic
A gift has been offered; it seems everywhere and nowhere; and one might be surprised into asking: Is this gift a sacramental sign? But what this all means, one does not know, and perhaps may never know.

But – knowing or not-knowing – there is nothing contrived about the question of God. It is elemental and enigmatic – elemental because of the givenness of self, other, nature; enigmatic because one is struck into an as-yet-uncomprehended astonishment by the givenness. The astonishing gift perplexes us about what offers it, or who.

### p.17 (approx) - Reserved Promise
The primal ethos of the between, and its reserved promise.

These overdetermined signs I will later explore in terms of what I call the hyperboles of being. There is something ambiguous, in a saturated sense, about the hyperboles. They are overdeterminate signs in immanence communicating of what exceeds exhaustive immanent determination or self-determination.

### p.133 (approx) - Communicated as Reserved
...remains in reserve, and is communicated as reserved. Perhaps something of this might be read into Kant's claim that the unconditioned was a regulative, not constitutive principle. We are driven to unconditioned "totality" by the conditioned intelligibility of finite determinate beings, but we can never make that unconditioned determinate.

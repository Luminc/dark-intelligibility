We are the struggle between consent and refusal, and not consent to this or
that, or refusal of this or that, but rather consent as an overdeterminate trust in the basic
goodness of being, or refusal as an indeterminate negation of, and dissent from, being as
good at bottom. The mystery of God manifested in the shock of evil makes of the equivocity of being a darkness against which we may rage, or in which may dawn on us the
consent to live uncertainly. These two are faithlessness and faith, and each is equivocal.
For the first is defined over against the second, as the second is gained, sustained only in
the face of the first. With us they are like Siamese twins, sometimes joined at the head,
sometimes the flesh, always in the heart itself, and perhaps in death only do they part.
For when they are parted, that is the moment of our death – and perhaps true life.

 I mean:
our second “yes” may appear to be true to the first “yes,” but it is feigned. A feigned
affirmation says “yes” but does not say “yes.”

Having lived thus and thus one just is that false
skin. To strip it away will feel like being flayed. We may need the discipline of a new asceticism: an aske
-sis that is a “no” seeking to waken again the elemental “yes” that endows and
blesses us. Any violence here, of course, is fraught with ambiguity, indeed danger. The stripping that claims to purify might secretly derive from the indeterminate negation rather than
the elemental “yes.” We are a mingling of opposites, and great discernment is needed to sift
them. There is an asceticism of hatred; there is a purging of love; and hatred may speak the
language of love. To see the difference we need love, but love may be what we most lack. 

p.36

The return to zero restores us to a condition of ontological vulnerability in which we are confronted with an “either/or” between an elemental “yes” or “no.” I recall that the Hermes figure – Terminus in Rome – was a boundary stone marking the space between the living and the dead. I further recall that Heraclitus said that Dionysus is also Hades (Frag. 15). The return to zero puts us in a place that is noplace. There is no “bottom”; nevertheless, we have reached “bottom” in the ordeal. And yet: though coming to nothing, we are not nothing. Though we might feel we are as nothing, nevertheless we still participate in an elemental affirmation of being at all, in that we continue to be. As being at all, we are already an affirmation of the good of the “to be” – even in the return to zero, it is good to be. For we are first an ontological “yes” – this surges in and through us in the passio essendi. But we are confronted with a further “either/or”: either “yes” or “no” in an elemental sense to being and the good of the “to be” in its worthiness to be affirmed or refused. If we say “no,” we may go under into despair. If we say “yes,” the “yes” is not determined by anything other than the rightness of the “yes,” and its fidelity to the given passio essendi. By virtue of the latter we are already participants in a primal affirmation of the good of the “to be” – ontologically we are the living of this affirmation before we know of it, and live it more mindfully. We can live in express refusal of this prior living “yes.” If here there is a second “yes” to the first “yes,” it is the mindful springing up again of the affirming energy of being, in our porosity to what is beyond us, and in the finite rapport of self-being and other-being. There is no argument for the first living of the ontological “yes”; it is a happening.

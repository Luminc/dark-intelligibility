### God and the Between

### Illuminations: Theory and Religion

Series editors: Catherine Pickstock, John Milbank, and Graham Ward
Religion has a growing visibility in the world at large. Throughout the humanities there
is a mounting realization that religion and culture lie so closely together that religion is
an unavoidable and fundamental human reality. Consequently, the examination of reli-
gion and theology now stands at the center of any questioning of our western identity,
including the question of whether there is such a thing as “truth.”
ILLUMINATIONS aims both to reflect the diverse elements of these developments and,
from them, to produce creative new syntheses. It is unique in exploring the new interac-
tion [[Metaxu|between]] theology, philosophy, religious studies, political theory, and cultural stud-
ies. Despite the theoretical convergence of certain trends they often in practice do not
come together. The aim of ILLUMINATIONS is to make this happen, and advance
contemporary theoretical discussion.

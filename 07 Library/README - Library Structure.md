# Library Structure

This folder contains key philosophical texts that inform the Dark Intelligibility project.

## Organization Principles

### By Author Folders
- **Desmond/** - William Desmond's works, primarily *God and the Between*
- **Nishitani/** - Keiji Nishitani's *Religion and Nothingness* and related texts  
- **Lispector/** - Clarice Lispector's literary-philosophical works

### File Types
- **Full Texts** - Complete works or substantial excerpts
- **Chapter Notes** - Detailed engagement with specific chapters
- **Concept Extractions** - Key ideas pulled out for integration
- **Reading Dialogues** - Your responses and conversations with the texts

## Integration with Vault

Each library entry should:
1. **Link to existing concepts** - Connect with your developed framework
2. **Generate new insights** - Allow texts to speak in their own voice
3. **Create dialogue** - Enable conversation between different sources
4. **Support writing** - Provide rich material for your own philosophical development

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Import** text (PDF upload, copy-paste, or manual notes)
2. **Initial reading** - Let the text speak without forcing connections
3. **Concept mapping** - Identify resonances with existing vault concepts
4. **Dialogue creation** - Write responses, questions, tensions
5. **Integration** - Link back to main conceptual network

*The library serves not as mere storage but as living dialogue partners in your philosophical inquiry.*

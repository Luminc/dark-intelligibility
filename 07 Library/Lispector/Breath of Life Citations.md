"The danger of stirring up hidding things -- and the world is not on the surface, it's hidden in its roots submerged in the depths of the sea. In order to write I must place myself in the void.

p.5 

"I write very simple and naked. That's why it wounds"

p. 6 

"In every word a heart beats. Writing is that search for the intimate truth of life. Life that disturbs me and leave my own trembling heart suffering the incalculable pain that seems necessary for my maturity"

Intimacy is a wound. The wound is a wound because vulnerability is not neutral. It is exposed. But the wound also transcends our own wounds. The wound of being is given to us. 

p. 8

There is again a sense of metanoetic command. I must do this, but the doing is not simply to save ourselves but others too. 

"My life is one single day. And that's how the past is for me is present and future. All in a single dizziness. And the sweetness is that it causes an unbearable itch in the soul. Living is magical and wholly inexplicable. "

p. 9 

"I only left what provokes and inspires me for life: a star lit at dusk."

"Unless he too [works] on the soliloquies of the irrational dark"

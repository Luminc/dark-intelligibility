"The danger of stirring up hidding things -- and the world is not on the surface, it's hidden in its roots submerged in the depths of the sea. In order to write I must place myself in the void. In this void is where I exist intuitively. But it's a terribly dangerous void: it's where I wring out blood. ... Writing is a stone cast down a deep well."

p.5 

"I write very simple and naked. That's why it wounds"

p. 6 

"In every word a heart beats. Writing is that search for the intimate truth of life. Life that disturbs me and leave my own trembling heart suffering the incalculable pain that seems necessary for my maturity"

Intimacy is a wound. The wound is a wound because vulnerability is not neutral. It is exposed. But the wound also transcends our own wounds. The wound of being is given to us. 

p. 8

"When I fall the human race inside me falls too."

There is again a sense of metanoetic command. I must do this, but the doing is not simply to save ourselves but others too. 

"My life is one single day. And that's how the past is for me is present and future. All in a single dizziness. And the sweetness is that it causes an unbearable itch in the soul. Living is magical and wholly inexplicable. "

p. 9 

"I only left what provokes and inspires me for life: a star lit at dusk."

p.12

"Unless he too [works] on the soliloquies of the irrational dark"

p.12
"I must be legible almost in the dark."

p.15 

It seems it's only uuseful to live interrogativelyt since every interrogation tossed int o the air has a corresponding reply formed in the darkness of my being, that part of me which is ddark and vital, without it I'd be empty. Whenever I do something deliberately nothing comes out, therefore I get distracted almost deliberately. I pretend I don't want something, I end up believing I don't want it and only then does the thing come.
p.65

Angela and I are my interior dialogue: I talk to myself. Angela is from my dark interior: she however comes to light. The tenebrous darkness from which I emerge. Pullulating darkness, lava of humid volcano burning intensely. Darkness full of worms and butterflies, rats and stars.
p.66

I just won't tell you the secret of life because I still haven't learned it. But one tday I shall be the secret of life. 
p.67

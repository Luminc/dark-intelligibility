Profound reorientation or turn

"great understanding or discernment" this definition brings it close to the idea of fidelity
 Discernment has another connotation than understanding, rooted in the intuitive ( which is more chaotic and close to non-understanding)

Metanoia

Definition:
Profound reorientation or turn. Often glossed as “great understanding or discernment.”

Dark Intelligibility sense:
Discernment is not the cutting of ambiguity into clear, fixed concepts, but the art of moving within ambiguity without being destroyed by it.

It is not a final knowing but a momentary crystallization in turbulent waters — sense and nonsense mingling, forming and dissolving. These “crystals” are not the whole ocean; they are gifts, provisional forms that help us navigate, not absolutes to be clung to.

Lispector teaches us that to understand is often to be disorganized, to lose the world we knew and enter a strange openness. Nishitani shows that true seeing emerges when we pass through the nothingness that underlies all beings. Desmond invites us to let-be — to welcome clarity without violating the mystery from which it springs.

In this frame, metanoia is a turn toward fidelity within unknowing.
It does not banish darkness, but allows brightness to emerge in the dark.

Do you want me to also prepare a link structure for your vault so metanoia.md directly connects to Dark Intelligibility, kenosis, and transtheism? That would make it easy to navigate the conceptual constellation.

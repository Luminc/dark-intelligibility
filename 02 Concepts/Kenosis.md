# Kenosis

**Self-emptying** — the paradoxical fullness found in allowing oneself to be emptied.

## In This Vault

Kenosis emerges as the necessary precondition for [[porosity]]. It is "the self-emptying required for true porosity"—not a negation of the self, but its radical opening.

### The Oscillation of Emptying and Filling

In [[Dark Intelligibility Beast]], kenosis appears as the dynamic tension of the [[Great Doubt]]:

> "A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied."

This is not a static state but a **living paradox**—simultaneously being emptied and filled, in "devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal."

### Kenosis and the No-sive-Yes

Kenosis enables Lispector's [[no-sive-yes]]—the capacity to say "no" to the ego's stability in order to say "yes" to the groundless ground. It is the courage to lose the "third leg" that kept one stable but prevented authentic movement.

### Embodied Kenosis

Through the [[pharmakon]] of ayahuasca ([[The Poison, the Purge. Being and Anthony Bourdain]]), kenosis becomes viscerally real—the body's surrender to what initially feels like poison, allowing the medicine to work through complete self-abandonment.

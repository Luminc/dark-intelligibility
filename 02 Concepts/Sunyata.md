My own sense is a bit bothered by the 'silent emptiness' you are portraying on the side of [[Keiji Nishitani|Nishitani]]. I see in fact a deeper coherence where sunyata collapses the emptiness-sive-plenitude , precisely how the self is affirmed by its interpenetration with all things. While both authors indeed stress different aspects, to me they are portraying, in their own way, not one, but two sides of the same coin, perhaps from different vantage points. For me, Nishitani has opened this sense of Sunyata that becomes a divine paradox. Our home-ground of being, our primal being as [[Desmond]] would say, is a space of deepest intimacy with the world when we "turn the light to whats directly underfoot". Both use the exact same movement of coming to nothing in order to "step back" "refuse even the refusing self" only to finally find "cessation" and "liberation". This makes clear for Nishitani why Samsara-sive-nirvana is immanent: Nirvana is "ready-at-being" ( borrowing heideggers ready-at-hand )

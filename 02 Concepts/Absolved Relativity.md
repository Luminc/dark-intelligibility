Desmond’s idea of **absolved relativity** goes beyond “simple relation.”

For him, ordinary relation (whether conceived univocally, equivocally, or dialectically) risks either reducing the terms to sameness, dispersing them into sheer difference, or sublating them into a self-enclosed whole. By contrast, _absolved relativity_ is a mode of relation in which:

- **The terms are genuinely themselves**: the self and the other are not dissolved into each other, nor subordinated to a higher synthesis, but released _for themselves_.
    
- **There is communication without absorption**: relation is not about dominance or reduction, but about a _freeing relation_ in which the other is allowed to be other.
    
- **It is grounded in agape**: Desmond frames absolved relativity through the _agapeics of community_—an unconditional generosity in which God gives from surplus, “absolving” relation of self-interest and turning it into a love that seeks nothing in return.
    
- **It holds the between open**: the _metaxological way_ discerns this absolved relativity as the primal ethos of togetherness between self, other, and God, while never forgetting divine transcendence. Relation is thus not exhausted by human categories or dialectical closure but remains porous to the mystery of the divine.
    
- **Creation itself is absolved relativity**: God’s creative act gives the _between_ to be, establishing a space where finite beings exist in their own otherness yet in communication with the divine origin.
    

In short, **absolved relativity is relation transfigured by unconditional generosity**: it is not a neutral “being-related-to” but a communicative, freeing togetherness that both affirms selfhood and releases the other in love.

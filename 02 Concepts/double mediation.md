# Double Mediation

Double mediation names the fundamental structure of being-in-relation that resists collapse into either immediate unity or irreconcilable dualism. Unlike dialectical self-mediation, which tends toward the absorption of otherness into an encompassing totality, double mediation preserves the irreducible plurality of mediating terms while affirming their genuine communication.

In dialectical mediation, the movement is essentially circular—from self through other back to enriched self. The other functions as a necessary moment in the self's own self-becoming, ultimately sublated into a higher unity. This produces what Desmond calls a "higher speculative univocity" where robust otherness is occluded beneath the totalizing movement of self-determination.

Double mediation, by contrast, operates in the metaxu—the between-space where genuine intermediation occurs without reduction to either term. Here we encounter what Desmond describes as communicative being: beings that are neither closed univocal unities nor dissolving equivocal multiplicities, but rather dynamic communications that remain porous to what exceeds them.

The "double" in double mediation refers not to a simple duality but to the irreducible character of the mediating relationship itself. Each participant in the mediation retains its own integrity while remaining genuinely open to the other. Neither collapses into the other, nor do they remain externally related—instead, they exist in a space of intimate yet respectful communication.

This structure appears paradigmatically in the God-world relationship. Against pantheistic absorption (God as the world's self-mediation) and deistic separation (God as entirely other to the world), double mediation affirms both divine transcendence and genuine relatedness. God communicates Godself to creation without becoming identical with creation; creation receives and responds to this communication while remaining genuinely other to God.

The porosity essential to double mediation—what allows genuine communication across difference—means that beings are constitutively open beyond themselves. This openness is not a lack to be filled but the very structure of finite being as communicative. We exist not as self-enclosed monads but as participants in an ongoing conversation that precedes and exceeds our own contributions to it.

The contrast with failed forms of mediation becomes clearer when we consider Hegel's famous critique of Schelling: "in the night, all cows are black." Hegel was targeting Schelling's Absolute as an undifferentiated identity that obliterates all determinate differences. But Hegel's own dialectical solution—while more sophisticated—ultimately faces a parallel problem: in the bright light of absolute self-mediation, all others become moments of the self-same totality.

Against both the "black night" of undifferentiated identity and the totalizing "daylight" of dialectical self-mediation, double mediation suggests what Desmond calls an "open whole"—a form of togetherness that remains dialectical without turning the Other back into itself. The open whole is genuinely dialectical in that it involves real relationship and mutual determination, but it resists the closure that would make otherness merely a transitional moment in the self's return to itself.

This openness is not a weakness or incompleteness but the very condition that allows genuine communication to occur. In the open whole, differences are neither dissolved in undifferentiated unity nor sublated into comprehensive totality, but held together in a space of ongoing conversation. The whole remains "open" precisely because it cannot close around itself without destroying the very otherness that makes it whole.

Double mediation thus offers a way of thinking relationality that honors both the reality of difference and the possibility of genuine meeting. It suggests that the deepest truth about being is neither solitary self-possession nor chaotic dissolution, but the patient, ongoing work of communication across the space of difference—a communication that transforms without destroying, that brings together without collapsing together.

This is why Desmond speaks of the metaxological as a "logos of the metaxu"—not a logic that masters the between from above, but a way of thinking that learns to dwell thoughtfully within the space of between, respecting both its communicative possibilities and its irreducible mystery.

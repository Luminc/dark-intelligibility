A **"no-sive-yes"** is a paradoxical affirmation that holds the tension between negation and affirmation without resolving it. It is the act of saying "yes" to the totality of being, which necessarily includes saying "no" to the parts of reality that are painful, unjust, or overwhelming.

It is the gesture of the Buddha "stepping out of the palace" to encounter suffering, or [[Clarice Lispector]]'s "disorganization"â€”a "no" to the stable, false self in order to say a terrifying "yes" to the groundless ground of being.

This is the core posture required to hold the [[pharmakon]] of being, embracing both its medicinal and poisonous aspects. It is the opposite of a simple, naive affirmation or a purely nihilistic negation.

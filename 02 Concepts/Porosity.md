# Porosity

**Porosity** is a central concept in this vault, referring to a state of openness, receptivity, and vulnerability to being, to the other, and to experience. It is the antidote to the closed-off, self-sufficient ego.

It involves a willingness to be affected, to be undone, and to allow the world to flow through the self. This is often a difficult and courageous state, as it means surrendering control and facing the "violence" or "grace" of the indeterminate.

### Key Aspects:
- **Agapeic Openness**: A generous, loving receptivity to the other. See [[The Poison, the Purge. Being and Anthony Bourdain]].
- **Metaphysical Vulnerability**: The courage to face Being fully, even if it means emptying the self. See [[Dark Intelligibility Beast]].
- **The Antidote to Refusal**: Porosity is required to receive the [[Pharmakon]] of being; its opposite is a refusal that leads to spiritual sickness.

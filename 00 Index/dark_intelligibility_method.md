# Dark Intelligibility

---

## 1. Incantation / Invocation

**Epigraphs**  
- “Become all flame.”  
- Lispector: *“Not dark, just without light.”*

Dark Intelligibility: not obscurantism, not mysticism diluted into cliché, but the fertile tension where intelligibility meets its own limits. A koan-like suspension: sense and nonsense orbiting one another, luminous and without resolution.

---

## 2. Cultural Framings and Their Limits

- Lispector as “witch” or “mystic”: gendered framings that romanticize, marginalize, or commodify.  
- Even empowerment narratives risk reproducing patriarchal logics.  
- What is at stake is not her figure but the confrontation with Being that exceeds categories.  

---

## 3. The Ordeal of Being

- Lispector’s ordeal: the *without words*, collapse of identity.  
- **Trial**: both life trying us and us trying. An ordeal that threatens destruction but also offers redemption without hope.  
- The **Pharmakon of Being**: medicine and poison. Metabolization as the capacity to receive communication from Being; pathology when it fails.  
- Counterfeits, doubles, violence of grace. Rilke’s imperative: *“You must change your life.”*

## 4. The Inhuman and the Intimate

- The *thing-part*, *matter-of-God*: intimacy of the impersonal.  
- Joy without hope: stripping away redemptive narratives.  
- Neutral as plenitude: semen, protein, cornucopia of the neutral.  
- Tenderness as both loving-kind and sore: sweetness arising in pain, co-being.  

---

## 5. Dark Intelligibility as Concept

- Not absence of light, but over-saturation. Light too full to bear.  
- Apophasis and phasis: negation and affirmation intertwined.  
- Lispector’s *orgiastic neutral*: plenitude collapsing into emptiness.  
- Desmond’s **day/night**: diurnal reason nourished by nocturnal mystery. Without night, reason goes mad.  

---

## 6. Comparative Resonances

- **Christian mystics**: Augustine (*intimior intimo meo*), Teresa, Eckhart, Julian.  
- **Nishitani**: Sunyata as nothingness alive.  
- **Desmond**: metaxu, thought *singing its Other*, quiet festivity of being.  
- Transtheism / agnostic theism: oscillation between absence and fullness of God.  

---

## 7. The Psychedelic Register

- DMT/LSD as catalysts of communicativity: being itself as medium.  
- Trance as sleep: dreams slipping from memory, *“already forgetting.”*  
- Hermeneutics of integration: metabolizing the dark illumination.  
- Pathology as failure to metabolize: the horror of the absurd.  
- Excess of communicativity: the hyperintelligible that communicates without language.  

---

## 8. Toward a Practice of Porosity

- **Attunement**: softly vigilant seeing, balancing territorializing gaze and deterritorializing reception.  
- **Kenosis, metanoia, letting-be**: emptying that is already full.  
- **Fidelity to the unknown**: dwelling in the neutral, celebrating the excess.  
- Thought as prayer, as celebration, as *“thought singing its Other.”*  

---

**Closing Gesture**  
Dark Intelligibility is not about making the unknown fully known, but about cultivating fidelity to the unknown as unknown. To inhabit the neutral, porous and festive, is to dwell in the mystery where intelligibility and its other nourish one another.

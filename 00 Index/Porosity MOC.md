## Core Definition
- [[Porosity]]

## Key Manifestations & Explorations

### Porosity as Courageous Surrender (The Lispector Axis)
- In [[Dark Intelligibility Beast]], porosity is the courage to face the "violence (or grace) of the indeterminate" and undergo disorganization. It is the core of [[Dark Intelligibility Structure]].
- It is what allows for the "no-sive-yes" and the reception of the gift of being.

### Porosity as Agapeic Openness (The Bourdain Axis)
- In [[The Poison, the Purge. Being and Anthony Bourdain]], Anthony Bourdain embodies a porosity that is an expression of [[agape]]—a generous, open-hearted love for the other.
- This note connects porosity to the [[purge]] and the concrescence of mind and body.

### Porosity as a Condition for Receiving the Pharmakon
- The note on the [[Pharmakon]] establishes that porosity is the necessary condition for allowing the "medicine of being" to work on us. Its opposite is the **refusal of the gift**.

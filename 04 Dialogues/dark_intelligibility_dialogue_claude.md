# [Dark Intelligibility]: A Philosophical Dialogue

## Introduction

This dialogue explores the concept of "Dark Intelligibility" through the lens of William [Desmond]'s philosophical framework, particularly his treatment of the [hyperintelligible] and the [metaxu] (the "between"). The discussion weaves together insights from Desmond's metaxological thinking, Clarice [Lispector]'s confrontation with the abject, Jungian shadow work, and [psychedelic experience].

## Key Concepts

### Desmond's Hyperintelligible

Desmond develops the notion of the "hyperintelligible" (*huperintelligible*) - intelligibility that exceeds determinate forms yet remains necessary for determinate intelligibility to exist at all. As he writes:

> "One might call hyperintelligible such an intelligibility that is more than determinate. Though the hyperintelligible seems a surd and enigmatic, it may be a necessity for there to be determinate intelligibility at all."

The hyperintelligible represents not a failure of reason but rather points toward "a truer truth" that emerges precisely at the limits where finite intelligibility encounters its own insufficiency.

### The Metaxu and [Overdeterminacy]

The metaxu - Desmond's "between" - becomes the crucial space where Dark Intelligibility unfolds. In the metaxu, we encounter what Desmond calls the "overdeterminate":

> "The creation of anything is certainly unintelligible if we cannot acknowledge the energy of being that passes from a source to an issue... In passing, the very energy of coming to be is in excess of each determination that it precipitates in the process of coming to be."

This overdeterminacy is not chaos but carries its own form of intelligibility - one that can only be approached metaxologically, through "finesse" rather than geometrical precision.

## Dark Intelligibility as Concept

### Beyond the Hyperintelligible

Dark Intelligibility emerges as a compelling term when we consider how the shadow/Jungian dimension intersects with what Desmond calls the "hyperbolics of evil" and the "violence of grace." While Desmond's "hyperintelligible" captures the excess of intelligibility, Dark Intelligibility suggests something more radical: that darkness isn't simply what we must transcend or integrate, but what constitutes the very condition of intelligibility's self-revelation.

### Integration of the Abject

Drawing from Clarice Lispector's unflinching confrontation with horror, Dark Intelligibility names how the abject becomes not what blocks intelligibility but what constitutes its deepest showing. As explored in our dialogue:

> "Lispector's genius lies precisely in her refusal to domesticate the horror... In her work, grace doesn't arrive despite the abject but *through* it, in what you aptly term 'the violence of grace.'"

### The Jungian Shadow

Dark Intelligibility connects to Jung's insight that individuation requires confronting the shadow, but pushes further: it suggests that the shadow isn't just personal but ontological - it's the darkness that belongs to being's own self-revealing.

## The Reconfigured Ethos and Forgetting

### The Necessity of Forgetting

Desmond's insight about protective forgetting illuminates how we integrate hyperbolic encounters:

> "We are often spared; for we cannot bear much. Forgetful relief offers us merciful release. But the suffering and release will be offered again, unexpectedly, with an inhuman peremptory, you are more ready now, now you can bear it, which is not to say we do bear it."

This mercy of forgetting protects the psyche while leaving transformative traces.

### Living in the [Second Ethos]

We inevitably live in a mediated relation to the primal:

> "We always live in a second ethos, since we find ourselves in the midst of things, as having already taken on a particular complex order of determinate happenings, relations, and so on... Our participation contributes to a reconfigured ethos – reconfigured in light of our fundamental orientations to what is, both actual and possible, our basic senses of good and evil, and so on."

We cannot remain in hyperreal spaces but must return to our configured world, carrying traces of the encounter.

### Porosity and Stability

The fundamental tension: we need both openness and boundaries:

> "We would find the porosity a pandemonium of presences did we not make firmer borders in it, or find ourselves shielded by the balm of forgetfulness."

Without "firmer borders" we'd be overwhelmed, yet we need porosity to remain open to the divine.

## Psychedelic Experience and the Hyperintelligible

### DMT and Hyperreality

The connection between DMT experiences and Desmond's articulation reveals the "more real than real" quality of hyperbolic encounters. The sheer excess of indeterminacy in these experiences is precisely what makes them both destabilizing and revelatory - a lived encounter with what Desmond calls the "too muchness" of the ultimate.

### The Agapeic Origin

DMT's revelation of a loving, compassionate primal ground resonates with what Desmond theorizes as the agapeic origin - the hyperintelligible source that gives without diminishment, like the Sun that shines for what is other to itself.

### The Trace

The mark left by hyperbolic encounter creates what we might call Dark Intelligibility:

> "A chink is cut in selving to the suffering of the divine. The cleft is felt in a kind of anguish. The heart is being enlarged beyond its human measure, and there is something inhuman about the strain placed on it."

This "chink" or "cleft" is the trace that remains - a knowing-through-wounding that persists even after protective forgetting.

## Dark Intelligibility and the Horror of Grace

### The Violence of Grace

Dark Intelligibility captures how grace can arrive through violent disruption rather than gentle illumination. This connects to Desmond's recognition of:

> "The horror secreted in the inward otherness of our selving – here the excess in self of selving that turns to the infernal."

### Beyond Domestication

Unlike approaches that seek to domesticate or transcend the horrific, Dark Intelligibility suggests that the abject, the horrific, becomes the very medium through which the hyperintelligible shows itself. The shadow isn't overcome but becomes the condition of revelation.

### Ontological Shadow

Dark Intelligibility points to shadow as ontological rather than merely psychological - it's the darkness that belongs to being's own self-revealing, the way consciousness becomes luminous precisely through its encounter with what it cannot master.

## Philosophical Implications

### Beyond Univocal Intelligibility

Dark Intelligibility operates beyond what Desmond calls "univocal intelligibility" - the reduction of being to mathematical determinacy. It requires what he terms "finesse" - a more nuanced approach to the excess of being.

### The Limit of Determinate Intelligibility

As Desmond notes:

> "The limit of determinate intelligibility is the frontier of mystery. Why not call this the edge of the hyperintelligible, not the unintelligible?"

Dark Intelligibility names this edge where ordinary sense-making breaks down yet profound communication occurs.

### Metaxological Thinking

Dark Intelligibility calls for metaxological thinking - thinking that can hold the tension between transcendence and immanence, light and shadow, intelligibility and its own limits.

## Conclusion

Dark Intelligibility emerges as both conceptually rigorous and poetically resonant - a term that captures how consciousness becomes luminous precisely through its encounter with what exceeds its grasp. It names the way intelligibility reveals itself through its own withdrawal, how grace works through disruption, and how the shadow becomes not obstacle but medium of revelation.

The concept bridges philosophical rigor (through Desmond's metaxology) with experiential reality (through psychedelic encounter) and literary insight (through Lispector's confrontation with the abject). It offers a framework for understanding how we integrate encounters with the hyperintelligible while maintaining the stability necessary for embodied existence.

In our reconfigured ethos, we live with traces of the hyperbolic - neither fully possessing the divine encounter nor entirely cut off from it, but dwelling in the Dark Intelligibility that marks the between of remembering and forgetting, presence and absence, light and shadow.

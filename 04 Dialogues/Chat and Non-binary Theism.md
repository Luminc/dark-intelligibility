Chat. What do you think about the idea 'non-binary theism'? It came to me while thinking of transtheism, a concept I'm expounding.

“Non-binary theism” — yes. That’s a compelling and provocative phrase.

It immediately gestures toward a theism that refuses strict oppositional logics:

not God vs no-God

not transcendence vs immanence

not presence vs absence

not male vs female

not even self vs other

Instead, it invites a metaxological, porous, and perhaps even transjective experience of divinity — one that resonates deeply with your work on transtheism.

Let’s break it open:
1. Against binary theologies
Most traditional theologies (especially Western, monotheistic ones) operate within binary metaphysics:

Creator / creation

Heaven / earth

God / human

Good / evil

Light / dark

These binaries often structure both metaphysical assumptions and moral hierarchies — and they tend to collapse into dualisms that exclude and stabilize meaning.

But the divine, in mystical and post-structural currents, is rarely so stable.

2. Non-binary theism as divine ambiguity
A non-binary theism might say:

God is neither wholly personal nor impersonal, but relational and emergent.

God is not One or Many but a becoming that refuses quantification.

God is not present or absent, but a felt trace, an excess.

God is not male or female, but matrixial, womb-like, khoraic.

God is not pure being or non-being, but dark intelligibility, pharmakon, kenosis.

3. Transtheism and trans-ing God
Your project on transtheism already moves past theism and atheism without negating them.
It’s not a cancellation, but a crossing.
The prefix trans- offers movement, tension, passage — exactly what the chōra embodies.

In this light, “non-binary theism” could be read as:

A theism that does not settle into fixed ontologies.

A theism that allows for multiplicity, fluidity, queerness, even within divinity itself.

A theism that affirms difference within God — like Nicholas of Cusa’s coincidence of opposites, or Desmond’s overdetermined excess.

It might even ask:

What does it mean to pray to a God who is porous?

What does fidelity look like, not to a Father or a Void, but to a God-who-becomes?

Can God transition?

Resonances:
Clarice Lispector: her It is non-binary.

Meister Eckhart: God as neither this nor that, but beyond God.

Derrida: “the name of God” is always deferred, always haunted.

Julia Kristeva: the semiotic (pre-Oedipal, choraic) precedes symbolic law.

Queer theology: challenging the heteronormativity embedded in classical theism.

So what do I think?
“Non-binary theism” is fertile. It doesn’t just add a new category — it ruptures the logic that made theism binary to begin with. It lets us feel toward God otherwise: in transits, thresholds, trembling membranes.

Would you like to try articulating a fragment — a short poetic or philosophical invocation of non-binary theism in your voice?

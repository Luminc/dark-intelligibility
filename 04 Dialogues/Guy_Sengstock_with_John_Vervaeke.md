[Music] thank you so much for tuning in to circling Dia
0:05
logos if you are inspired by what we talk about on this channel and want to
0:11
dive deeper and in fellowship with others there's a number of ways you can
0:18
do that one is to become my client and work one-on-one with me we also have
0:25
circling events every week open to the public we also do weekend intensives for
0:32
circling every 4 to 6 weeks or so and we have a year-long art of circling
0:40
practitioner training program we also have self-study programs that you can do at your own
0:47
pace all the relevant links including my email is below in the show notes please
0:53
let me know if you have any questions
1:00
welcome John so good to see you it's great to be here guy yeah so good to see you too I've been really looking forward
1:08
to um to to this dialogue on desmen right uh and been you know and as as we
1:16
were just talking about before we we started recording I don't think I have
1:23
been touched by an author like this since
1:29
heiger like and I'm really quite surprised I'm
1:34
really kind of a little bit taken aback by it right like um there's a there's something he's
1:42
addressing and I think you know and I wanted to talk with you about this too because I keep thinking about
1:48
like you know what's at stake in his work right is such a has such a ring of
1:57
what's most in intimate yet most ultimate right at the same time and
2:04
there's a way he comes about it that is really quite unique in my experience
2:10
right but also you know in in some
2:16
sense well I can put it like this it's like um you know maybe you've noticed this too it's like when I teach you know
2:24
and I'm Fielding questions and stuff and sometime you know sometimes people ask questions and I kind you kind of get the sensor as a question underneath the
2:30
question but you're not quite hearing it right and if that's kind of happens what sometimes what I'll do is I'll just ask
2:36
well what's at stake in the question and if they can articulate what's at stake oftentimes the very
2:43
articulation of that at stake answers their question or at least makes makes
2:48
the thing the real question clear and you know feeling into what's
2:54
at stake right in in uh Desmond's work right
3:03
I I I get a very strong sense that there's something very similar at stake in your
3:10
work yeah uh that's uh that's my sense too and I'm glad uh you brought it up
3:17
that way so um yeah Desmond is profound uh two thinkers that are having a huge
3:24
impact on me right now I mean overall are Des William Desmond the philosopher
3:29
for a theologian he won't say what he clearly is and that's to the that's to the good and then the sociologist
3:37
hartmut Rosa and his work on resonance and these two things are talking to me very deeply yeah um and so not only am I
3:44
reformulating how I understand meaning in life I'm reformulating how I understand uh relevance realization
3:50
perhaps we can get into that I mean there's other thinkers that are having a huge impact on me uh thank you by the
3:56
way for uh kopo biano his stuff is amazing amazing on heiger um and the and
4:02
the alexandr book on haiger and neoplatonism just brilliant and and and
4:10
and but there's a difference and you're exactly right you know andov and capab biano they're saying something very
4:16
important um and and they're they're really strengthening the argument about a deep connection between neoplatonism
4:22
and haiger and perhaps at some point we could have a dialogue about that topic but to to your point um Desmond I think
4:32
is for me I think uh Desmond is the prophet and I mean
4:40
that in the biblical sense of the Advent of the Sacred I hope you're enjoying this video so far just wanted to remind
4:48
you if you are interested in diving deeper in what we talk about here on the
4:53
channel in fellowship and in a more embodied way there are number of
5:00
relevant links in the show notes including working with me one onone as a
5:06
client all the information is below including my email address yeah uh that's that's my
5:14
estimation of him to look for how the sacred is trying to be reborn for us and
5:21
I think that's precisely what's at stake in Desmond uh Desmond is providing the
5:27
fundamental uh philosophical framework for wrestling with our
5:33
appropriate orientation and uh appreciation of the
5:38
Advent of the Sacred that's uh that's what I see in Desmond and that's I think
5:44
that's what perhaps you were intimating uh it was the the connection between my
5:50
work and his work that's that's how I see it that's how I experience it that's how he is reshaping my thinking yes and
5:57
and I mean I've been very deeply helped by a couple of really great books um these are the two books I'm going to use
6:03
in the helan course on Desmond and God and the between which will fill out the trilogy of uh Beyond nihilism and
6:10
Ultimate Reality God and Beyond and then we we're going to do William Desmond God in the between uh religion metaphysics
6:16
and the postmodern William Desmond and John D Caputo by Christopher Ben Simpson
6:21
just a brilliant book he's one of yes yes yes it is really brilliant yes
6:26
yes and that's very good because uh know this is a sustained argument about the
6:32
recovery of religion post postmodernism um and and uh and that
6:38
goes so well uh with the cor the course I recently did on you know uh
6:44
reimagining re recovering religion um and then uh Ryan dun uh spiritual
6:50
exercises for a secular age Desmond and the Quest for God yes I just got to read that one yeah that's really good yeah
6:58
yeah these These are both and so and these two books I mean they're both about I I don't think it's in in
7:05
inappropriate to say they're both about how Desmond's work is about
7:10
reorientation uh to that is appropriate to the Advent of the Sacred and that's
7:16
having a so th those two authors I mean I have a whole bunch of anthologies people by DC Schindler and others uh
7:22
writing about Desmond U but those two authors are really shaping my reading of
7:28
Desmond yeah well you know there's something about there's something about
7:34
the way he writes right that is and this is where it reminds me
7:42
and is grabbing me similar the way that like when I started reading haiger you know in in my early 20s kind of
7:49
spontaneously um grabbed me in the sense there's like what he's saying right and
7:55
there's the arguments he's making and there's the you know the thing that you're learning but there's the ride that you the walk
8:02
that the way he has you walked right is as much Exemplar is is an example of the
8:09
thing that you're learning about right so you're kind of I always get this sense of like in Reading there's the way
8:15
he's approaching it there's the way he's saying it it's the the notes he's hitting you're you're actually he's
8:22
actually in some sense evoking the very process of coming to right like the walk
8:30
that you're making and it's like yeah so dun talks about this he
8:36
makes a really uh really valuable connection between uh Desmond a and um uh Charles
8:45
Taylor Charles Taylor has a he describes the way he argues with a very bad uh
8:52
designation he calls it argument ad hominum that just upsets everybody because ad hominum arguments are
8:58
fallacies and means attacking the person and not the argument so it's a infelicitous name I don't know why he
9:04
picked it he's generally very good at naming things it's a really bad name I would propose what tayor is talking
9:11
about is argument by transformation so what Taylor says is what he does is he doesn't try and
9:16
convince you he tries to shift you right from one uh Viewpoint and uh right so a
9:23
huge emphasis on perspectival and participatory change what theoria used to make he takes you through theoria he
9:30
takes you right through transformation so you can see and be differently and then you compare and then you get this
9:36
retrospective reflective criticism of where you left from and then that's how
9:42
the argument persuade you that's what that's what Desmond is doing I think I think dun is right about that I think
9:48
that's Desmond's style of argument he takes you through these things through Thor theoria as this journey to CNB
9:55
other than you are and then you're you're constantly refle reflecting back
10:00
right and right and you get this retrospective reflective criticism of uh where you started from and then that's
10:07
how you're persuaded about this in a very powerful way that's how I experience it yeah and what's really
10:14
yeah you know is you're talking about that this you know articulating these
10:20
arguments right in some sense he's articulating kind of the AR the
10:26
arguments and the understanding that are like my own pre like my own background presuppositions it's not
10:33
just talking about something well that's exactly that's that's exactly it I mean that's what I mean he he he is deeply
10:40
theoria and theoria I've got a book I haven't started reading yet theor is ultimately the Quest for the Divine the
10:46
Quest for the sacred right um and yeah so what like it's like Murdoch uh you
10:54
know and right the sensibility Transcendence as you do this as you as
10:59
do that retrospective reflective wow I my previous View was so limited and so
11:06
constrained um you then no no it's not that you just you it's not that you just come to a reflective criticism of your
11:13
view you come to a reflective criticism of your viewing and you start to consider a whole different way in which
11:20
you and the world can be in proper relationship to each other uh and I mean that's what he means by I think by the
11:27
the mological uh yes right uh coming to that uh and that's the other reason the Deep
11:33
resonance between my work I think the Meto olical is the ontological correlate
11:39
of the practice of dialog dialogos of the dialogical so I think dialogos is the
11:46
proper realization of the met mological and the metox olical is the ontological
11:53
grounding of Theos so yeah yeah I I appreciate you saying that because one
11:59
one of the things that I've been you know one of the things he talks about is this um you know you can really hear you
12:06
can hear this you know what you've been emphasizing so much in your work which is like the gr the ground maybe the
12:12
ground of reality is relation right like yeah yeah yeah
12:18
totally two things yeah yeah and well he even goes he goes to the point of making
12:23
the point that otherness and relation are equally primordial uh they have
12:29
they're the I'll use some heiger here they're not identical but they're the same they are interwoven together in
12:35
this profound way and that and I think that's what James filler is trying to get at with pure
12:41
relationality um like this indeterminate source of relationality I Like the Way
12:46
Desmond makes this makes the case that you know being exceeds but is not other
12:53
than intelligibility yeah and intelligibility because it's inexhaustible being is an
12:59
inexhaustible source of intelligibility right um and as itself non intelligible
13:05
it's not logically identical to intelligibility but right but they're inseparably bound together and then
13:12
intelligibility exceeds determinacy because of its open-ended self-transcending nature and it's like
13:19
like it's that's so powerful that's so powerful and I think that's that the
13:25
only way that can land in you in the the trans formative theoria way we've been
13:30
talking about is if you move in I don't even want to say conceive uh I want to
13:36
use this movement like you have to move into pure relationality yeah yeah yeah
13:42
in this in this way where you know uh a
13:47
couple of things like one of the things I've kind of it's like personally been impacting me is it's it's having me see
13:54
what the essence of what we've been doing in circling right I feel like it's just I'm like oh
14:01
this is it and this thing that's been so difficult to put into words it's like it it it it begs it begs words but bucks
14:09
words right um and also in the way that uh you know some of his his
14:17
distinctions in language has been um affecting my experience in meditation right in a big way and I
14:26
wouldn't have I wouldn't have thought I wouldn't have anticipated that right kind of just you know before before
14:31
reading him but it there's a way that it he's T he's addressing something that well in his
14:39
terminology what is most universal and intimate right the intimate Universal in
14:46
his in his language right in this in this way that
14:51
uh you know a kind of a Reawakening to like the
14:57
the an original paracity right to that we are you know as he in his language
15:04
you he's talking ontologically he'd say like we are kind of a paracity to right
15:11
the over determinacy of being of that that there is anything at all right and
15:16
that we are we show up already in relation right um and we are a paracity
15:23
to that relation and that in some sense this um
15:29
that orientation is a kind of is is a over determinancy which I think is such
15:34
a is such an interesting way of that right like
15:40
because you you think about there's determin right there's indeterminacy and he's keeps he keeps circling around this
15:48
this this phrase over determinacy yeah I'm curious like what
15:54
and so for me yeah go ahead yeah so I was just gonna say over go ahead go
15:59
ahead yeah I just wanted I wanted to actually get kind of explore your thinking about that particular phrase
16:05
because what I hear in that in some level like my initial like thought was okay overd determinacy I get this sense
16:11
of like I don't know something above me that's like just you
16:17
know over stressing a determination on me or something like that right like was
16:22
my initial I'm like why is over what's great about this but I really kind of get this sense of of the too much Ness
16:29
the Surplus that that every every appearance in sense is a promissary note that that
16:36
exceeds anything that appears so there's that quality of like it shows Itself by
16:43
withdrawing and that thing that's showing that by withdrawing is I think what you're getting at when you were
16:48
talking about you know the The Shining
16:54
forth of emanation that shines forth the very withdrawing into mystery so there's
17:00
this quality of inexhaustibility this Surplus um this uh this this um pointing
17:08
to what uh what is not a this or a that yet is is a commun that's communicating
17:15
to you right yeah yeah I really want to resonate with that so over determinacy I
17:22
think is I can't distinguish it from my notion of inexhaustible intelligibility
17:29
uh right the over is the inexhaustible and the determinacy is the intelligibility and he's putting the two
17:34
together and they're absolutely bound together although they're not logically identical because the one right the
17:41
ultimate is itself non- intelligible precisely because it is the source of all intelligibility but this doesn't
17:46
this isn't and that's ultimate but it's it's an ultimate intimate because it shows up in the unlimited
17:55
multi-perspectival multi- aspectuality of anything I can never realize all of this thing
18:02
right and then but but then the between shows up as the through line the no
18:10
aspect no perspective that runs through all aspects and all perspectives and it's not an abstract conception it is
18:18
the very pronounced Presence at the heart of my phenomenology of my sensense
18:23
making right it's like the through line isn't it's it's it's intimately ultimate
18:30
right um and so all of that and then and then that the he he does two pairings he
18:36
does intimate ultimate intimate Universal I I I I don't like that as much as intimate ultimate because the intimate ultimate I think is a little
18:43
bit closer to what he's talking about I I understand why he does the intimate Universal but the intimate strangeness
18:48
is also one that I really like because it picks up on these two aspects right
18:54
the the intimate is like the way he's playing with the two meanings of meta in metaphys physics the intimate is you
19:00
know it's in our midst right like meta as me in the midst but right it's
19:06
strange in the sense of like it it takes us radically other than where we are and who we are and that's the ultimate right
19:13
and and and that right that's the other sense of meta right and he's he's so
19:19
another thing I see him doing that's part of the Advent of the Sacred is the recovery of metaphysics post heiger post
19:28
post modernism which I think is is is really important especially because I've
19:35
become very convinced yeah of an argument I'll only make in very brief
19:40
which is that uh the the key postmodernists dareda and
19:46
Fuko um are deep followers of haider's critique of Plato yes and in fact I've
19:55
read I've read several different authors that say the one thing that holds all of of postmodernism together is a hatred of
20:03
Plato um and then if you go into all these books you and I have been reading
20:08
and filler's work and and drop off's work and capab bianco's work and others uh Gear's work and just so many um no no
20:17
haiger is actually pretty much a neoplatonist and he's misread Plato very
20:22
deeply and that means the postmodernists are misreading Plato very very deeply and therefore their critique of medic
20:28
physics as platonism is deeply misplaced and so we need a recovery of that kind
20:36
of metaphysics in which we're talking simultaneously about being in the midst
20:42
but also that is intimate to us but also intimately right intimately with the
20:47
ultimate that is other than us Beyond us that is the what he calls the transcending transcending Transcendence
20:54
like all of that yes so sorry I'm getting very excited this stuff uh what Desmond is doing I think is
21:00
really powerful those two meaning these are our these are our this is our intimate sense of realness realness is
21:08
that which is intimate to us confirms comes to us and it it is that which
21:13
surprises us and shocks us Beyond ourself and right those are the two
21:19
senses of realness and he's he's getting that and he's putting us right back in the phenomenology and then he's saying
21:25
what does our ontology have to be like in order to Pro properly appropriate
21:30
that ontology and I think that's just profound yes yes in this and I think I
21:37
think the intimate ultimate is a good name for the sacred the intimate ultimate I think it's a very good name
21:43
actually yes yes in in the way that it situates you in in the in the maxu the
21:51
between which is really interesting like you know and I think it's you know he's got these terms it's funny reading him
21:58
is like my first thought of like reading him I was like oh this is this is
22:03
the this is the Hegel I want to read when I read Hegel right like well he's
22:09
got he's a deep critic of Hegel he takes Hegel very seriously deep yes one of the best critics one of the best in yeah and
22:16
in that sense he's got he's got like gestures of that hegelian kind of
22:23
um dialectic right but without the totalizing systemizing right into
22:29
Eminence right like um he's got he's got there's an awareness of of a of a of a
22:35
necessary like systematizing but yet that system is is constantly referencing
22:40
what can't be systematized right like yes like exactly yes so so so that's
22:49
that's the other part of the argument Hegel is the other Grand source of postmodernism as you go through Hegel
22:55
and Marx and so he is going back and to my mind he is providing a an alternative
23:02
to haiger and Hegel not not simply a rejection I'm using that word very
23:08
carefully an alternative that allows us to go back because the other person he's rereading deeply he's getting the term
23:14
taxu from is Plato and Plato and the between that we are between our humanity
23:20
is to home ourselves identify ourselves with the tonos logos of finite
23:27
Transcendence because that is what that holding that between right is what most
23:34
appropriately uh humanizes us and helps us to cultivate wisdom and I think and that's what dun is picking up on how
23:41
Desmond is also Hado that's the other person he's picking up on you know Desmond is picking up on hio
23:48
as philosophy as philosophia as as spiritual exercise yeah totally you know
23:55
and then that and that kind of you know these these these
24:00
um you know basically you're starting to name some of what he in in his language his companions right like yeah yeah yeah
24:09
way that like ultimacy right is constantly a companion right it's of you
24:15
right it's it's this it's this otherness right such that that you are in in a
24:22
sense is not is is like th whereas like Hegel talked about you know thinking thinking itself
24:29
right whereas Desmond saying no it's like thinking to to to think other than
24:34
itself right to to meet what is other than itself is to think right in some in
24:40
some sense but this um this way that it's this really interesting and it's
24:46
I'm G see if I can try to put this in the words but you know in some sense I think what
24:54
he's doing and I think he explicitly talks about this you know um you know I think the way he
25:01
would put it he's like you know since since the enlightenment philosophy and kind of metaphysics right
25:08
has turned towards religion right turned towards art but in a certain sense uh
25:15
kind of demanded that that art and religion and theology account to it it's
25:20
an asymmetric relationship it's an asymmetric Theology and art and politics
25:26
have to be accountable to philosophy but philosophy doesn't have to be accountable to them he doesn't do so
25:31
much to politics because we're going through the thing where we're trying to make everything accountable to politics and I I think he's but the idea yeah
25:38
that's why I said I wouldn't call him a philosopher or a theologian he wants to hold the tonos between them theology
25:44
should be accountable to philosophy but philosophy should be accountable to Theology and I think that's the great difference between him and Hegel and
25:51
that's the difference he like when he does his thing on the four senses of being the four-fold you know he goes through the univocal which is really the
25:57
enlightenment there's a universal singled determinate formal system of intelligibility and then that breaks
26:03
down and then we go into no no there's all these we go into the equivocal meaning being being is necessarily
26:09
pluralistic and fragmented and then we get the dialectical no it mediates itself right it mediates itself uh and
26:17
and it comes to uh you know this this resolution but then he he moves to the dialogical and he says no no you know
26:24
that that's that's not enough you know you have to be open open to the the fact
26:31
that you have to be called by something that is
26:38
not invested in your project of self-mediation nor ultimately under the
26:45
authority of your project of self-mediation and when like that was just for me just like oh
26:52
yeah again that can you just restate that like under the authority of say say that you have to you have you you have
26:59
to you have to be the dialogical is to feel called to something that is not
27:05
reducible or constituted by your project of self-mediation which is what dialectic is dialectic is I encounter
27:12
the other but It ultimately get resolves back into the system whereas the
27:18
dialogical is no no no no system right exist in a self-sufficient fashion it is
27:25
always being called Beyond itself into the space of self-transcendence that is not located in the system to use
27:32
nishitani's words it's the baso of the system it is the the it is the place
27:37
with with within which the system unfolds and and grounds it and governs it um and so that's and and that's why I
27:45
mean when when he he calls the last stage The Meta olical but it's what you and I have been calling the dialogical
27:51
as opposed to the merely dialectical for a long time and and that's that that
27:57
that that verticality uh and and uh the vertical metaphor is used by Desmond and
28:03
especially by Ben Simpson that's missing in Hegel to my mind there is some discussion of the Sacred but the sacred
28:09
is always like under the authority of the process of dialectical the system of
28:16
dialectical self-mediation yes um and for Desmond no no no that that is to
28:21
make theology totally subserving to philosophy and what they have to have is a relationship of reciprocal
28:29
reconstruction have to have to be in between philosophy and theology I would also say put science in there in a
28:35
different way but we can leave that for for down the road a bit but that's what I meant that's what I meant that's what
28:42
I see in Desmond and his critique um and it's like yeah because if you get the
28:47
dialectical you you you do become you you do ultimately get into a version of idealism in which the system of
28:56
intelligibility is self sufficient and self-contained and we now know goal and
29:02
Einstein etc etc my work on relevance realization such a thing is actually not
29:09
possible right it's not possible yeah totally and
29:15
it's yes and it's not right is is um is
29:21
not a stop right but it's a continually beginning right it's not it's it's in
29:27
between constantly draws into more and more relationality yeah so that's where I see
29:34
the that's where I see the connection between Desmond and uh Pan's work especially through Esther leap's Meek
29:39
book contact with reality where pan makes the the argument that what
29:44
actually is our sense of realness our sense of realness is not closure or completion our sense of realness is
29:52
indeterminate future manifestation uh which is I had a little bit before St right on yeah yeah now he
30:01
he actually also does it retrospectively it's very much again analogous to what I've been talking about with
30:06
plausibility we a lot of things converge and we get in that sense we get a confirmation that gives us a sense of
30:13
trustworthiness but what we get is we now place our trust in the promise of
30:19
new discovery of new understanding of new conception of new practice and we
30:26
get the sense of promise and we and it's a trustworthy sense and that's our sense
30:31
of realness yes yes totally and and that's what Desmond
30:37
is talking about and that's a that's a between Place yeah that's that's the between right there yeah yeah it's like
30:43
it's almost like the more it's like what s the felt sense of the more real it is the more it
30:50
emanates in an exhaustibility right that's right that's right and that's that's that's Pen's point and so
30:57
he pan very similar to the way Desmond wants to rebalance the relationship
31:03
between philosophy and theology uh pan wants to to rebalance the relationship
31:08
between Discovery and justification in science the enlightenment because it was so concerned with skepticism because it
31:14
was bound to representation etc etc right and um and correctness to use
31:20
haider's term right it was all about justification but penus says no
31:27
what really gives us our sense of Truth is not just justification it's
31:33
justification in in relationship with Discovery and he says we need to re
31:38
prioritize rebalance at least our appreciation of how much the discovery
31:44
aspect of science is part of how it persuades us of Truth as much as the justification and when I when I said
31:50
that when I saw that and understood that I went oh my God that's so deeply right if you actually do science the
31:56
justification it matters I don't want to say it doesn't right but the discovery
32:01
matters as much if not more to your sense of I'm tracking reality here I'm
32:07
on theoria here I'm tracking reality yeah totally yeah you know and it's it's
32:15
interesting this you know and I think this maybe accounts for or points to some of the
32:22
way that the walk he puts you on right the
32:27
practice I element right the theoria I think has to do with this way
32:34
in which he is in some sense um having his thought and in a certain sense metap
32:42
modern metaphysics um uh account
32:48
to what is more ancient than it right like um art and and religion and
32:54
theology in that sense this answering to it
33:00
right it's and don't you think that's because there's a CO co- answering I mean yeah I think there's definitely
33:06
coing right but I think and in a certain they're all Co they're all they're all co- answering the sacred that's what I think he's arguing totally there's a
33:13
community to use another one of his terms there's a community among them yes and and a kind of like in in in in this
33:20
kind of philosophy in a sense coming back to answering to Art right um to
33:27
religion which is I think he's emphasizing that because you know it's like that's the thing that hasn't really happened much right so that's the thing
33:34
that's new in some senses is for thought to to to to think it's think it think
33:40
itself before other than itself right um and be before that you there's this quality to his
33:48
work where I get this sense it's almost like I don't know if I could put this in the words I get this sense it's like
33:53
there's something deeply confessional about it right it's almost like in his speaking of metaphysics right
34:01
modern metaphysics um and like in its turning and answering to what as he would say in
34:10
his language uh not just like you know the
34:15
the overcoming of the Canad cende but the
34:21
original right the like acknowledging and opening up paracity to the original
34:26
pasio ascende right the the given to be right not just the to be but the given
34:33
to be and acknowledging in a certain sense
34:39
kind of I always get this sense like he's like from within within metaphysics he is like simultaneously being
34:47
metaphysics confessing to its forgetfulness of what is its own origin
34:53
right in some sense there's a it's got this confessional nature to it that's so
34:59
evocative do you do you kind of hear what I'm saying with that I do and and I want I want to I
35:05
want to I want to try something out on you I want to try how the theoria journey um can be understood in the
35:12
language of relevance realization um first of all I want to I want to read a quote from uh uh Ben Simpson thinking is
35:21
in between totalized enclosure of rigid Universal objective and the fragmented
35:27
discont ity of equivocal subjective thinking okay one more time can you read
35:32
that one more time thinking a thinking Desmond is proposing a thinking is in
35:40
between totalizing closure of rigid Universal
35:46
objective and the fragmented discontinuity of equivocal subjective
35:52
thinking it's in between those two yes okay totalizing closure of a r a
35:57
universal objective that's algorithmic right discontinuity of
36:03
equivocal subjective thinking that's arbitrary relevance realization is
36:08
between the algorithmic and the arbitrary when I realize that something
36:14
is relevant I can't do the algorithmic search but I don't just arbitrarily guess I
36:21
somehow come to that which is neither algorithmic nor ARB and is
36:28
therefore properly between me and the world let me keep going so that's
36:33
relevance realization now now think about intimate strangeness intimate
36:40
strangeness is right this sense of it's coming in but it's drawing me Beyond
36:47
this corresponds to in in dynamical system what's called criticality right where the system is right in between
36:55
stable and completely chaotic and broken down it's the place where information
37:01
processing is most optimized Insight is most possible transformation is most
37:07
possible with so it's that in between criticality is the dynamical sweet spot
37:13
right now that in betweenness that right that criticality this is what hermit Rosa calls resonance resonance is when
37:22
you right you come to the place where right
37:28
you are like he helmet Rosa says you you come and you see the snow falling and
37:34
you pause because it reflects the controllable uncontrollability of the
37:40
world you are s you're at this point of criticality where you're it's making sense to you but you're intimating
37:48
pregnantly intimating it its inexhaustibility and you start to resonate with reality like this is
37:54
reciprocal opening right and this is relevance realization move into
37:59
resonance sounds very much like I out too yes very much that's exactly what it
38:04
is and that's that's that's when relevance realization properly realizes
38:09
reflectively appropriates its inherence TR its inherent transcave nature and it
38:14
comes into that appropriately but it doesn't stop there right because there's
38:20
a calling now and Rosa talks about you know we we've lost the ability to listen to The Calling um and so we've lost our
38:27
culture lost resonance we should do a discussion about helmet Rosa too by the way but think about this when you when
38:33
you Orient towards ultimacy you when you Orient towards breaking through onto theology towards being that is not any
38:41
being or even the abstract property shared by beings but the grounding field
38:48
of being when you when you Orient towards that relevance realization comes
38:53
to a place when it can realize its own irrelevance it can have that ultimate
38:58
right thing we were talking about earlier where wait this isn't just a new view my my whole way of viewing has been
39:05
wrong and when relevance realization Falls silent before being as like this
39:11
goneld that's reverence and reverence is the attitude of
39:16
confession oh okay yeah you're right you're right
39:24
because there is this yeah you confess yes there's like there's there's an over
39:29
there's an overflowing and an already admittance to a kind of inadequacy to what I'm
39:36
yes confession is to inhabit finite Transcendence properly like with
39:43
reverence right confession can become P sadistic and masochistic and all the
39:49
stuff that you know the church has been criticized for but when when confession is the training in both senses of the
39:56
word like the practice like um like you both practice like getting better at medicine but you also practice medicine
40:02
as a doctor uh confession is the practice of reverence it's the practice of
40:08
appropriate right realization admittance inhabiting of one's finite Transcendence
40:15
I'm finite but I'm bound to a Transcendence but I can never completely ident I can never be logically idential
40:22
with the Transcendent because it is also always expressed in the finite that that's what confession is I am finite
40:29
before the Transcendent but it it doesn't destroy me right I don't just
40:34
confession is not despair but confession confession is The Sweet Spot between hubris and despair it is it is the it is
40:41
the practice of reverence that is like that's so the way
40:48
you just like tied all that together
40:53
um has me want to confess right
40:58
but but but think think I mean and notice
41:04
what I I was able to align that with some pretty well articulated well-defended
41:11
cognitive science yes so notice that this this thing between philosophy and theology is also doing it with science
41:19
there's a triangle there right right they're they're they're singing to each
41:24
other yes yeah that's yeah they're singing to each other kind
41:29
of in some sense disclosing and admitting what is beyond them and this
41:35
before them this kind of sense of this thing that he keeps emphasizing right this um this this ultimacy of all
41:45
otherness right that it continually you're delivered over forward and recognizing it it is before you but also
41:51
before as before you but also before you right this yeah yeah yeah yeah like this
41:58
constant this the sense of things and one of the things that I think um I find another thing like in
42:05
compelling right where he's he these the way he talks about uh the E the ethos
42:13
right the PRI like the the the the primordial ethos and the and then he
42:19
talks about the reconfigured ethos of our time and it's funny when I hear him
42:26
kind of you know is I kind of attuned to what he he's kind of pointing at there I
42:31
keep thinking about like that his his notion of ethos right which is where we live right the between um and the
42:39
reconfiguring of the ethos I keep thinking about like in some sense it's it starts that's the four EAS isn't it
42:46
right in some way well I think it's the four EAS but I think I I I agree with
42:52
that but I think it's the four EAS in proper orientation yes um so know he he
42:57
goes through like as we go through theoria he also like he has this developmental thing we start with what
43:03
you know original astonishment then we do first perplexity curiosity which is the having
43:09
mode and then second perplexity which undermines the having mode and then we recover a second astonishment yes uh
43:15
right um and um I think that astonishment that he talks and so the
43:21
recovery of it right I map that on the the original astonishment is ethos and
43:27
then the reformulated ethos is second astonishment yeah and I think it's the
43:33
four e but I think it so there's two things that maps on to one is um um onon
43:40
normativity the ethos is a pre-ic goodness of being right a deeply
43:48
pre-ic it's pror it's it's what makes all of our judgments of the true the
43:53
good and the Beautiful and their betweenness possible so is onto normative it is the goodness of being
44:00
and we get and we have that by pre-reflective participation we go through all of this
44:06
and we get postrefractive participation in Aon normativity and so
44:13
we were living it and then we moved to realizing it post-refractive so compare
44:18
the difference between participatory knowing that's implicit and unconscious and panian and how it gets explicit
44:27
in right in mystical participation Oneness with God that's
44:33
reflective participatory knowing and that's reflective onon normativity
44:38
that's profound appreciation in both senses of the word of right the
44:44
participatory knowing of the goodness of being that is prored that makes the true
44:50
the good and the B the good the true the good and the Beautiful and their Oneness their non-identical Oneness possible
44:57
that's what I think he's talking about and that's how it connects to the four e because at the bottom and and in a sense
45:04
at the top of the four e is participatory knowing pre-reflective participatory knowing and
45:09
post-refractive participatory knowing I'm writing a paper with Hussein and Daniel about that right now actually Oh
45:16
Oh that's oh that's awesome yeah that's awesome yeah in this you know it's really quite striking
45:23
of course I keep thinking about your work as I'm reading about this right
45:29
um but I mean you know in in some sense
45:34
um you know so so this is where I think that there's something very very very strikingly similar about what you guys
45:40
are doing right um and that he's he's talk he's talking
45:46
about the the the the uh the modern postmodern the current the current
45:53
reconfiguration of the ethos right as used this term called we like it's like
46:00
we we are in a default atheism yes yes and but that that that
46:08
yeah okay that's where I resonate with him too because I've been when I did the when I did the course on you know
46:15
recovering religion I I said I started the course by saying I'm not going to do the enlightenment project yeah yeah I'm
46:23
not going to give you a definition of re uh of religion what I'm going to do is
46:28
I'm going to take apart the gridlock grammar of all the disastrous dichotomies that were given to us and we
46:34
take them as second nature uh as how we should see the world like the the you
46:40
know the subjective and the objective dichotomy the fact value dichotomy the is a dichotomy right um the theory data
46:49
uh doconomy and the religion science dichotomy and and the Fable that they they've had nothing but a relationship
46:55
of conflict with each other um and and and and once you do that and you take that apart right then then then
47:03
then you then you you you see exactly you see exactly what you're talking about there and and for me that's that's
47:10
that's the Deep realization uh of the transcity of relevance realization that
47:16
it is before between Beyond these dichotomies in a really really powerful
47:22
way and when you when you break down the fact valued economy right you break break down what drives us to the default
47:29
atheism because the fact value economy makes us there's a valueless set of
47:35
facts out there objectively and all we have is a purely subjective valuation of
47:41
them in here but objectively we ultimately have no value no real value
47:46
and so all we have is what do you see say something like the valueless valuing of a valueless world yeah that's atheism
47:54
that's that's an atheistic nihilism and the thing the thing I was appreciating about my sense of what he's what he's
48:01
saying is he's like saying that and if you think think about it like temporally right
48:07
historically that that in other words we're in in ethos that it's a default
48:12
atheism but what what I don't think he's saying is like doesn't mean that people are walking around with a bunch of
48:18
conscious propositions about I you know no I have a materialistic Viewpoint I
48:24
don't believe in God that like that's how about that he's talking about something Much More Much More um
48:31
Insidious right that yes B saying if you are born in in this in this age in this
48:39
this this time that the very architecture right the very like that
48:44
you live in the vernacular the presuppositions the V all the things that you do um you will you will
48:53
basically um live out an nihilistic um sense of reality is a kind of a
49:00
serviceful is is this is a great another great term of his a service serviceable
49:06
disposability right like yeah yeah yeah yeah if you think about that like that's
49:11
such it just it just highlights the time that we're in as being such so extraordinary right to any other time
49:19
that that without thinking about it if you're of this time you will and and how
49:25
I hear this is he talks about's like like look I'm I'm talking about it from within it right he's saying right he's
49:34
saying like and he's saying something there meaning like meaning that um you
49:40
get this sense that even if you go and become a monk and live in a monastery right you're you can't escape
49:48
this thing right that there's something there's something uh to be to be
49:53
confronted here and so in some sense he's saying it's in this confrontation
49:59
with this is where one can maybe you know as he would say to to
50:05
to uh to come to thought of God right for thought to come to God in a in a in
50:13
a much more original sense of the word but from within this and so how I get
50:18
this parallel like that like in with your work and it's one of the things I noticed right away in watching you know
50:23
when I before I even met you and watching um The Awakening for the meeting crisis I
50:30
mean one of the things I really I appreciated was there's a this way that
50:35
like you were you were not just you were not just teaching
50:41
right and informing but you confronting right you're yeah yeah right
50:48
like this kind of way there's a way that you you know in your lectures where you just get you get really animated right
50:54
and you got this sense that like you were kind of trying to existentially confront us not with you but with what
51:02
we're actually confronted by but we're blind to in some sense this kind of yes
51:09
you okay you're sparking so much and I wantan to give me some time on this because okay so the default atheism
51:15
which is as you said ins the Insidious implicit or the implicit Insidious I don't know which way we want to do it
51:21
right exactly I I I agree notice that that's the same status with the meaning crisis and this is part of what I'm
51:27
trying to reformulate the the the construct of meaning in life right if you ask most people according to the
51:33
standard psychological measures they they come out above average like in the
51:38
standard sign like because these are questions about do you have a sense of purpose right do you have connection so
51:43
if you have family and friends and and a job and some obligations you'll have a sort of meaningful life in that way and
51:50
it's like yeah but there's a problem here and the problem comes from the in
51:56
ious nness of the fact value subjective objective because the word meaning is
52:02
not a purely descriptive term it is not like red it is like rational rational
52:08
both describes and prescribes when I say somebody's life is Meaningful I'm not just describing it I'm praising it
52:15
there's an inherent normative Dimension so that means it is right and proper to
52:20
ask is this going well or poorly this meaning in life is it actually affording
52:27
people becoming more wise is it affording them a depth of and and scope
52:32
of connectedness it so for example how sharable is your meaning in life with
52:38
other people how communal is it how communicable is it or are you isolated
52:44
in your own little individualistic bubble with your little tiny thing so we could also ask people how how ordered is
52:52
the world how beautiful do you find the world or is the world more and more filled with and are you in you
52:59
are you more and more cycling between busyness and burnout and boredom as you
53:04
relate to the and so all of this is being missed this is the Insidious implicit nature people can and you know
53:12
and I'm not denying their experience just like people don't experience themselves perhaps as atheists because
53:18
at the level of their propositional assertions they're not atheists at the level of their propositional assertions
53:24
and some of their affect they have meaning but that's not what we're talking about in the meaning crisis
53:29
we're talking about we can like that meaning is ultimately profoundly at risk
53:37
because it has been severed from what meaning in life has always been bound to
53:43
cross-culturally cross- historically which is the cultivation of wisdom so if you ask these people in so this is a
53:49
product theory of meaning it doesn't tell us the process and if it's normative just like look being Ral part
53:57
of what it means to be rational is to Aspire to being more rational if meaning in life is normative a proper part of
54:04
that is the aspiration to making your life more meaningful that requires wisdom so we can ask people like do you
54:10
what are you doing to make your life more meaningful and how are you overcoming the self-deception and and and the and the
54:19
that undermines that people won't have any good answers for that
54:24
right and that's the way in which the meaning crisis is Insidious now think about this you have default atheism and
54:31
you have default meaning crisis the Advent of the Sacred is the co-response to both of those it's a recovery of God
54:38
that is the Advent of the Sacred which is the proper response to the meaning crisis yeah yeah completely now yes yes
54:49
well just one more thing about that i' be really careful here and I'm really going to ask for Indulgence to not be
54:55
misinterpreted but I been thinking a lot because of Desmond and because of
55:01
alexand and alexandrov and because of C bian Capo biano right um like because
55:07
there's this triangle of Pho phos Sophia the cultivation of wisdom pis as the
55:14
making of new sense in response to being called and proa the
55:21
confrontation with something that is calling to us right and the three of those together and and again I I don't I
55:30
I don't I want to be really careful here to not inappropriately self-label but I think what you were pointing to is that
55:37
and I don't think I was doing it particularly excellently but I was aspiring to somehow speak from the
55:43
between of philosophia ois and propheta I don't say prophecy because we've
55:49
degenerated prophecy into for fortune telling where prophecy is about telling
55:54
forth It's about confronting it's about letting what is beyond us speak to us yeah right uh to confront it that's
56:01
exactly the right word prophecy is about the intimate right the the the intimate
56:07
implicit imminent right that needs to be that needs to be confronted um and so I
56:13
think that that triangle of philosophia pois and propheta is the way in which we
56:20
Orient to get the core core core I don't want to say correspondence that the
56:27
co-creation the the co- calling between the overcoming of right default atheism
56:33
and default meaning crisis in the Advent of the Sacred that's where my thinking is at right now yeah I can feel I can
56:40
totally feel feel that like so many things are coming together in this right because you can even you can hear even
56:47
hearing that coming together you can hear that notion of the confession right this yes yeah yeah this is one of the
56:54
things he's you know it it it's interesting because in in in God in the between which I think I think is his
57:02
most um I don't know uh most for formal like register of of
57:11
his thinking that I that that I'm aware of he's it's really interesting where he's kind of talking about and I'm it
57:19
there's it's he's so close to nishitani here right oh totally right in where
57:25
nishani says about like here the problem is is that like is not to go away from nihilism it's to go deeper into it to go
57:33
like the great doubt is problem is we're not nihilistic enough right and and and
57:39
Desmond has his own way say going to zero right and he's like and even
57:44
talking about like to fully die is is for death to is is to is to die so
57:50
deeply that that death reveals its own inherent Beyond itself right like
57:57
there's this you know there's these kind of Senses of of where he's like no don't
58:02
turn away from the reconfigured ethos go deep into its implications with your
58:07
whole being like confront it right be in the presence of it and this and it's
58:13
through that something this the the a different sense of the Nile right like starts to uh starts to
58:21
become starts to emerge I I think that's right and I think um I think he's actually doing
58:28
both nishani and tab the metano etics and tab
58:34
right he's other power that sweet spot between self- power between self- power
58:40
and other power that's exactly what uh Desmond is talking about and I also think it goes back to what we were
58:46
talking about earlier argument by uh by transformation argumentation by transformation theoria as the journey um
58:54
that gives you that respective rospective self-correction yeah um theoria
59:00
discloses uh performative contradictions not just propositional contradictions because you realize not just what's
59:07
wrong with your view you realize what's wrong with your viewing which is you start to see performative contradictions
59:13
and that's nishitani's great point right the book before uh religion and nothingness um at least um in terms of
59:21
what's available in English I mean it was chronologically but for me it was like it's just before because I don't
59:27
think there's any published by nishitani in English between those two books is the self-overcoming of nihilism the self
59:34
over you f the the idea is when you go into the great doubt you Ral ultimately
59:39
a kind of performative contradiction that becomes more important to you than like any propositional contradiction
59:45
that's what theoria does it discloses the fact that wait there's something profoundly blind spot about nihilism
59:53
it's unlivable in a blind spot way the way you knower Frank glyer and Thompson
59:58
talk about and when you realize oh no blind spot is just as bad as
1:00:03
propositional contradiction right and then and and that's what opens you up to this exactly what you're talking about
1:00:10
it's like oh right right this is this isn't resolved by some coherence between
1:00:15
proposition this is resolved by a fundamental realignment within and without in between yeah to in this yes
1:00:23
in this way where he you know you know he kind we and we can all we can all see
1:00:29
this it's like where you know if you if you just look at the you know the the modern atheists right um filled with
1:00:37
idolatry right like rationality is like and he's and he's and he's talking about
1:00:43
like these counterfeit doubles like he's basically talking about idolatry that just inherently comes with a
1:00:49
nihilistic stance and what he says is really interesting he says yet the very
1:00:57
Idol presupposes right something that isn't an idol for which you can mislocate it
1:01:04
right that but isn't that the same or at least convergent with my argument that
1:01:10
the distorting appearance the hermeneutics of Suspicion is dependent on the what I thought yes yes yeah
1:01:17
that's exactly it the the idol can the the idol can become the beautiful icon
1:01:22
yes right right totally totally and so it's kind of like this and this there's
1:01:28
this way where he's you know he's talking about like and I think this is what I also hear you talking about as of
1:01:34
late you know as you were talking about in your course of like you
1:01:39
know say saying like did kind of deconstructing these kind of like uh um
1:01:45
the is autis distinction right the underlying right dualisms or contradictions that un you know
1:01:51
underline a lot of Enlightenment thinking right and
1:01:56
what I hear you saying is like by in some sense deconstructing them right or
1:02:02
taking their own logic pointing to itself and watching it fall apart then let like kind of let that
1:02:10
happen and then see and and and not then to go okay what is religion right as if
1:02:16
you can make religion an object of thought right that's what that's what happened
1:02:22
in my course I said what we'll do is we'll do this and then I just you to pay attention to your religio your sense of
1:02:28
connectedness and how the sacred as that which is ultimately real ultimately
1:02:33
transformative and ultimately orienting now becomes possible a lived possibility
1:02:39
for you and that's what we're going to point to with the word religion and all of my students who all of them this is a
1:02:45
fourth year course they've all taken multiple courses with me and they all of them individually came to me like one by
1:02:52
one and said this was the course I always wanted you to teach this is the best course you've ever done yeah yeah
1:02:59
yeah because because notice and this is what this is what this is what Ben Simpson is saying notice the move you made notice it says there like this is a
1:03:07
response to postmodernism because it picks up on that postmodernism was the recognition of the need to deconstruct
1:03:15
the binaries the dichotomies the dualism but it was so hostile to Plato it it
1:03:23
blinded itself to the possibility of second astonishment it blind although
1:03:28
you see Fuko moving towards care of the self in stoicism and you see dareda orienting towards neoplatonism as
1:03:35
because I think they're getting a sense that there's something more here there's
1:03:40
something more uh but they don't they're too bound to the proposition on the political they're too bound to the
1:03:46
proposition on the political because they interpreted the doomies as through a completely nitian lens and I think
1:03:54
that um the the deconstruction of the economies through completely nichan uh
1:03:59
lens and I think one of the things that Desmond does and Ben Simpson makes it really clear is he offers us an
1:04:07
alternative to the deconstruction of the economies that's not Nan and it's
1:04:13
grounding yeah yeah absolutely absolutely what D what was that like
1:04:19
getting that feedback right in that like that must have been just really uh uh I
1:04:27
I can't imagine what it was to experience receiving that feedback and that response to to something that you
1:04:36
taught it was deeply humbling um yeah yeah um you know I I I felt I had to be
1:04:45
responsive and responsible to something that was um I'm and I don't mean this with
1:04:51
false modesty I want I want to try and state This truly yeah for which I'm inadequate and
1:04:57
I'm but but nevertheless I so I tried to
1:05:02
hear it as um feedback that I had done my very best
1:05:10
even though I was inadequate um and that I had given it my very best and that it
1:05:16
was received as something that was very helpful to other people but I did not
1:05:21
get any sense yeah I think I can say this very honestly I did not get any sense of
1:05:27
idolatry about my work or the arguments or the presentation yeah
1:05:33
yeah and I want more and more that to be the case the whole pivoting away uh that we've been doing at the Veri Foundation
1:05:40
the pivoting towards the El turn that you know I have subscribers and students I don't have fans I don't have an
1:05:46
audience um like and and trying to engage in more peer conversation and
1:05:51
less you know just presentation of my ideas and my work um um that I think helped me show
1:06:02
up um more virtuously I mean I I don't want to pretend because I'm not a saint
1:06:07
or a sage I don't want to pretend there wasn't ego gratification in there um but
1:06:13
I I you know I've been trying to practice um you know using in in my dayto day
1:06:19
life using you know uh mild and moderate uh humiliation and just being with that
1:06:27
instead of trying to respond to it internally or externally and just no let's let's just be with that let's
1:06:33
let's just do this as a little bit of ego fasting let's just let's let's take this as a gift yeah that person hurt you
1:06:40
or and you could say something externally or you could say something internally to make yourself feel better don't feel better feel bad like you're
1:06:46
the way you were saying earlier feel bad down deep like Let It Go deep let it open you up uh let let it be a kind of
1:06:53
ego fasting like try and sense like what you do in Lent what's it like to taste
1:06:59
the world without the ego being super Centric and super Salient like and and so that's been helping me too about that
1:07:07
you know just just trying to orient that way uh a little bit more and appreciate those moments as gifts yeah and so the
1:07:15
the the the really helpful turning that you know Chris and Ryan and uh Ethan
1:07:21
afforded at um you know for the veru foundation yeah one of the you know I've got a couple other practices that's just
1:07:28
one these practices I've been adopting uh encountering this work uh just going
1:07:34
back again and again again to the neoplatonic proposal about holding not holding being the tonos between finitude
1:07:42
and Transcendence these these were all coming together and I think they helped
1:07:48
me not simply slide into egocentric uh gratification yeah yeah
1:07:56
totally you know there's something about um yeah there's something so when he
1:08:02
told me that you know last time we had talked about you know and how I heard it was you know this a couple things like
1:08:09
putting myself in your position um you know I I had asked you like it is the outcome of this is that
1:08:18
something that kind of like were you did you recognize going into the course that this is going to be like a real
1:08:24
culmination in some sense right of of whole work and you're like not not
1:08:31
really and so just imagine you coming to the experience of that
1:08:38
right like realizing that yeah like it was yes and no um it
1:08:45
was yeah we talked about it like I I didn't know yeah I
1:08:51
suppose looking back on it now I think I was hoping that it would and I was
1:08:57
trying I was trying to do like what we do in di dialectic into dialogos I was trying to collect the logs so this I in
1:09:03
the hope that the spark would catch yeah um and if you're if you're looking for resonance you can't manufacture it you
1:09:09
can prepare for it but you can't manufacture it and there's a big difference between preparation for
1:09:14
something that has to show up of its own accord and trying to manufacture it
1:09:20
right and so I prepared for that and I
1:09:25
was was gifted with it happening and that's how I felt it I felt it as a gift and thus thus the
1:09:32
feeling of on one level being deeply acknowledged but that your response to that acknowledgement is a deep humility
1:09:39
a deep felt sense of of yeah and just a deep I mean I could
1:09:46
have screwed it up in so many ways Beyond like the obvious ways of you know
1:09:52
the lecture running poorly I could have SC screwed up in so many you know psychosocial ways um that it seems I
1:10:01
didn't and you know and when you when I screw up you know uh in the other courses as
1:10:08
long as I get you know the proper presentation of the theoretical arguments and the evidence they're screwing up it matters I don't want to
1:10:14
say it doesn't matter but it doesn't there's still enough in there but for this
1:10:20
course that had that had to go well or the course wouldn't go well at least that was my
1:10:26
sentiment yeah yeah you know as you're talking about that I'm just kind
1:10:31
of feel just kind of feeling into my own experience with teaching and you're right like there's this
1:10:39
um there is this way that you can you can prepare But ultimately right it's a
1:10:46
it's it's a it's a relation it's a it's relational right like it's not a
1:10:52
profession it's a
1:10:57
and it's more like this it's it's this it's the practice of it is I
1:11:03
noticed when it sings like that right yeah yeah well that's exactly I was
1:11:09
gonna say it's more not doing something or something it's more like a place you
1:11:17
sit and it's like it's almost like it's like I can feel me like moving my butt
1:11:22
around and finding that place to sit right yeah well I I was saying to uh Hussein
1:11:29
and Daniel and writing the book about the four the four Ps that uh particip
1:11:34
participatory knowing is about implacement not space but implacement in
1:11:40
in the way you're just talking about there and and most of that's always going on um you know implicitly
1:11:47
unconsciously uh but yeah it's it's very much like that and and resonance is what
1:11:53
turns a space into a place you're just moving through space and then you hit the snowfall or the sunet
1:12:00
and it suddenly becomes a place for you and what and you get that exactly that what you just said you C you can you you
1:12:07
could you could you could have developed a character that dispositionally prepares you for for manifestation but
1:12:15
you can't manufacture it and that's Rosa's notion which is very uh very convergent with the default atheism that
1:12:21
Desmond's talking about because we are like roses at the idea that we have
1:12:26
moved to a place of what he calls Dynamic stability which is we have to
1:12:31
keep growing just to not fall behind or lose
1:12:36
what we have this is why we're busy unto death right this is why and this why we burnout and you know that Han talks
1:12:43
about the burnout Society right and what's going on there is
1:12:49
exactly right that the the the hyperdrive of we're going to
1:12:56
manufacture right we're going to manufacture we're going to innovate we're going to make we're going to manufacture we're we're going to keep
1:13:02
growing and there's nothing like like there's nothing intrinsically wrong with growth to some extent but of course uh
1:13:11
right we we've lost that being connected to any kind of moral project we just we're just doing it now so we don't miss
1:13:18
out and we don't fall behind and this of course is killing us that's part of his notion uh of of of resonance
1:13:26
but he says but the moments that people
1:13:32
actually live for are the moments of resonance there are the moments in which
1:13:37
we get that yeah sense of realness and this goes to DC Schindler's the real is
1:13:44
that which is for itself it's not for us yeah if it was for us it falls into our
1:13:52
subjectivity now the enlightenment Miss understood that for itself is that it
1:13:57
objects to us it resists us and then we understand our relationship to it as
1:14:02
Will To Power right but it's not for us nor against us it's I mean that sounds
1:14:10
like a such a silly thing to say but in a profound way we we have those moments of resonance where we realize reality is
1:14:17
not for us but it's not against us and that's what Desmond that's the between of Desmond as well I think Rose's notion
1:14:24
of resonance is the phenomenological realization of the between right and
1:14:33
that's the place where we most get access to reality and I think that's why we love it because it is where we get
1:14:42
that that criticality that allows us to most be on that sweet spot we are most
1:14:48
available to track reality yeah so it's funny I'm really kind of G getting the
1:14:54
sense of feeling and as you're talking I'm thinking about the what kind of like what berer talks about like you
1:15:01
know first of all existentially human being we are it's all relation we're in one of two yeah um uh relations we're
1:15:09
either in a in in an i it or an i thou
1:15:15
and and what he says is really interesting he says he emphasizes this and he says now both are spoken as one
1:15:22
word right so they're word pairs they belong together right but he says eye of
1:15:27
it is not the same eye as the eye of thou right and this is kind of the I
1:15:34
would say this is the fundamental practice of circling right is this kind
1:15:39
of uh when we practice circling it's this feeling dropping into this sense of
1:15:46
I thou and you can feel it like you can literally feel it like when you're before somebody and like you're you know
1:15:53
there's somehow an IT me and and like you're concerned about what they think of you and all that kind of stuff and
1:15:58
then all of a sudden like you shift and I shift from you go from an it to an end
1:16:04
in yourself right and you can feel in that shift it's a different it is it's
1:16:09
an arising of a different eye right that is before
1:16:15
thou and it's kind of like this attuning to the heyen between it right it's like
1:16:21
yeah yeah yeah like that's I like that you just said yeah keep going that's good it's it's a participatory thing
1:16:28
it's like such a yeah and it's it's a it seems to be I keep thinking about the
1:16:35
deepest notion of hearkening right of listening oh right and there's something
1:16:42
about this in like in that distinction between hearing and listening right like I can hear noise but I can only listen
1:16:50
to a signal like you can't really listen to noise listen in presupposes
1:16:56
intelligibility right yes it does so there's this kind of interesting sense of like and I was as we were talking
1:17:04
about with teaching of like okay how is it that um this strange paradoxical
1:17:10
sense that you can't you have to in some sense let it arise right there's a patience of being right um in this kind
1:17:19
of place that you're coming from and I've noticed that for me and this is what I heard in your course like you un
1:17:26
you know you deconstructed these dichotomies and then you basically said okay now let's just notice what happens
1:17:33
what arises in you right and it'd be so easy in that moment right to just fill
1:17:39
that space in right with more ideas and more language or something like that and I
1:17:45
would imagine a kind of negative capability right and like letting that
1:17:50
silence be there and really listening right
1:17:56
in some sense there's um that's where the magic comes from right is this and
1:18:01
and I notic in my own teaching it's like when I kind of go astray it's usually because there's some there's some sense
1:18:07
of like I've lost Trust of that silence or that that that that that space I'm not attuned to it as much versus I'm
1:18:14
more attuned to it and I can kind of like let that silence be there and then something opens up that I that I could
1:18:21
have never have said right in that way first of all this is beautiful and I I
1:18:27
like what you just said because there this aligns with sort of the argument I've been making about attention and you
1:18:34
know mole's notion of cognitive Unison integrated with Pan's notion um so
1:18:40
paying attention isn't an isn't itself an act it's a way of doing other things paying attention is how you transform
1:18:46
the processes of hearing into the act of listening where you're doing instead of just right you're what you're doing is
1:18:53
okay what we're going to do is we're find the intelligible pattern in this right and and and and that reminded me
1:19:00
of you know of of Murdock in the sovereignty of the good that there's there's a way of paying attention that
1:19:07
is a hearkening uh that and Dyan talks about this there's two ways of paying attention you can pay attention when
1:19:12
you're trying to grab the world you can pay attention in the way in which you're trying to make a space in which you can hear the world or I'll use your word
1:19:19
better where you can listen more deeply uh to to the world and I and I I want to
1:19:24
pick up on one thing think about and this is again my my critique of the psychological construct the
1:19:31
psychologists talk about how people have meaning in life so think about all like
1:19:36
how think about having you know goals and friends and family and you know and
1:19:43
you've got that connectedness but it's all still within the IIT mode you don't have I thou resonant meaning in life and
1:19:51
it's and it's proper to make this distinction because meaning is not just a descriptive term it's a normative term
1:19:57
and I bet if you get people to experience both that sense of connectedness within I it and that sense
1:20:03
of connectedness with an IA which do they want which will they remember at their at as they get near their death
1:20:11
like and I I I am confident they will point to the resonant IOU moments where
1:20:17
they don't have meaning of life they be it right they're realizing it um so
1:20:25
that's Again part of the problem uh and this is self-critique in in Awakening from the meaning crisis
1:20:33
and in a lot of my work I just adopted the psychological construct of meaning
1:20:38
in life without any critique and I become increasingly dissatisfied and I'm now
1:20:44
going to publish a critique and and this I I I I I should be properly very
1:20:52
quite sternly critical of myself because I'm the person that goes in to existing psychological constructs
1:20:58
like mindfulness and wisdom and rationality and does a huge reconstruction and then I didn't do that
1:21:05
with meaning in life I just took the psychological construct as sufficient I think it's necessary but I my critique
1:21:11
is it's nowhere near sufficient it's nowhere near sufficient yeah yeah and so again but that's again how insid in like
1:21:20
we're here are people talking about meaning in life yeah but there's a performative contradiction because the
1:21:26
way they're talking about it is from this completely internal completely individualistic completely right
1:21:33
isolated fact valued economy running IIT orientation that actually isn't the
1:21:40
optimal form of meeting in life yeah totally totally
1:21:48
yes yes beautifully
1:21:53
confessed well I mean you know I think spinos is right truth is always retrospective reflective self-correction
1:22:00
yeah that's that truth is truth is never just the coherence of our propositions or or the impossible correspondence to
1:22:06
reality I mean I think heiger and df's critique of the correspondence model is is devastatingly correct it literally
1:22:13
makes no sense yeah it's a Vicken Stein it's a picture that has Us in it scrip
1:22:18
but it it's a picture that actually makes no sense um and so um yeah yeah I
1:22:25
I was I I I I made a mistake in in just a fundamental way um and um well there
1:22:33
it is you know and you know and I I made a mistake in in the series I presented it
1:22:39
monologic um and that's a mistake and that's why the book is written in dialogical partnership with one of my
1:22:45
greatest dialogical Partners uh Christopher Master patro um you know uh
1:22:53
so I I I've made a lot of mistakes and um I just want to own up to them and and
1:22:59
and you know I try to teach my kids when you make when you make a mistake to properly ask for forgiveness is not to
1:23:06
say the words please forgive me it's to say it's to admit a failure and then to
1:23:11
make amends that's what you do right that's what you properly do and in this in the way that you're talking about it
1:23:17
right now I'm not hearing a sense of like any
1:23:22
finality I'm actually hear ing the Beyond from which revealed it as a
1:23:28
mistake is somehow present in your confession of it right like yeah I'm
1:23:33
gonna be confessing until I die yeah I it's so funny you know I you know with with filler I and my conversation with
1:23:41
James I hope you got a chance to see it yeah yeah yeah loved it you know and and
1:23:47
and the trinitarian structure of of of of being and and then you know with
1:23:54
Schindler and the the E the Ecstasy of love and the Ecstasy of reason being bound together and now with Desmond
1:24:02
about the the maxu of finite Transcendence and you know uh continual
1:24:08
confession that is not self- laceration in any form um yeah I I you know it's
1:24:14
it's um uh I know why I'm not a Christian but in
1:24:19
some ways I I get what Sara says when she says to me she says I actually think you're one of the best Christians I know
1:24:26
yeah and she doesn't have a necessarily positive view of Christianity she has a positive view of me thankfully uh but um
1:24:33
I understand um and so part of what's also happening on the philosophical Silk Road the pilgrimage even as I as as I
1:24:40
properly going through kind of a lentin uh preparation for it because lent is
1:24:46
the proper preparation not manufactur the proper preparation for the Advent of
1:24:51
the Sacred and and I was talking with Hermes about it he said you're you're you're on a dark
1:24:57
road back to Christianity and and it's like I don't
1:25:02
know what that means and he said I can't fully tell you because if I fully told you it wouldn't be a dark Road um and I
1:25:11
don't know what that means I I don't know what that mean I don't call myself a Christian I don't I don't there's many
1:25:17
things that doctrinally Christians take to be Central to their self identification that I don't identify
1:25:23
with it's it's not just a matter of not believing them I I I I don't don't I don't identify with them they can't become living options for me um so
1:25:32
that's also one of the things that Desmond and Copo biano has done for me
1:25:38
is like I keep coming back to this you know this dark recovery of what
1:25:46
Christianity at least could mean um yeah I'm very well aware of what it the many
1:25:53
ways it does mean and I reject many of the ways it does mean in the world that
1:25:58
hasn't changed for me I can't forget yeah what happened to me or what I've
1:26:04
seen it do and how it's destroyed other people the various versions of it but I'm also seeing what it's doing to my
1:26:10
good friend Jordan Hall like how it's making him and Jordan I if you happen to
1:26:16
watch this I hope you mean I hope you take this as a loving compliment it's just making him a better person yeah
1:26:22
he's warmer accessible yeah he he's like he was always a noble person yeah that's why he
1:26:30
was my dear friend but now he's becoming he's moving he's he's he's
1:26:36
complimenting the the the the movement towards sagehood with the Ori the movement towards saintliness yeah and
1:26:44
it's just making him a profoundly good person yeah and you know and and you know of course my beloved friends
1:26:51
Jonathan Pou Paul Vander clay Bishop Maximus who I admire I admire Bishop Maximus um
1:27:00
yeah so you know I don't know what this all means but that's another thing that Desmond's doing to me yeah and doing
1:27:07
through me yeah you know when you talked about I really appreciated you talking about right
1:27:13
what you know um is you talking about and and
1:27:19
I've I've heard other people tell you this right in some sense you're more Christian than any Christian I know
1:27:24
right like that you I hear you when you say it's touching something there but that you don't know what exactly that's
1:27:32
touching and I sense of like I wanted to see if this is what I thought about was
1:27:38
there's that you know in very early Christianity what like Christianity was
1:27:44
synonymous was a way there was like a way like the they
1:27:49
used to call it the way like most originally in that sense
1:27:55
yeah and that's right I mean when I was I don't like cop bianco's the what is it
1:28:02
heer's Vineyard or yes beautiful book he do he does the one chapter on the crucifix yes and the one that t Francis
1:28:11
uh isn't he great so much isn't he great I I got a cop I have a copy of it in in
1:28:16
the library now in my library it's like it's like I have a like a three-dimensional like I have an actual
1:28:23
crucifix yeah yeah yeah you and he and he was and he was just articulating how
1:28:30
and I don't think he's read Highland maybe he has but and he was drawing out you know the the latter heiger is
1:28:36
talking a lot about the later haiger I should say is talking a lot about finite Transcendence and how the crucifix
1:28:42
represents is this icon of finite Transcendence and then it just hit me
1:28:48
and I I said oh my gosh I Now understand what Augustine means when he saw
1:28:55
Christianity as the Fulfillment he called it the completion which I think is the wrong word but the Fulfillment of
1:29:01
platonism because platonism is all about realizing and inhabiting finite
1:29:06
Transcendence and then Christianity is is the iconic make making sacred of like
1:29:14
how reality discloses itself to us from the place the implacement of finite
1:29:21
Transcendence and I got I get what he means because they are not only called Christianity wisdom even before sorry
1:29:29
away all the way back to Justin Martyr really early they're calling it also a
1:29:35
philosophia a cultivation of wisdom and I think both forms of Christian sorry
1:29:41
both of those aspects I got to slow down I'm getting too excited both of those dimensions of
1:29:48
Christianity a way of wisdom and a wisdom way yeah I don't encounter them
1:29:54
and a lot of the Christianity I met I grew up with and I encounter in popular
1:29:59
media I do encounter it in people I do encounter in Bishop Maximus Jordan Hall
1:30:05
Jonathan Pou Paul Vander clay and so um
1:30:11
yes that's where I'm at that's and you know I've been really heartened
1:30:17
by the response to my participation in the gospel seminar uh I I I I I I I forne I was
1:30:26
just going to get a lot of people that pronounced that I was either demonic or stubborn or just didn't understand and
1:30:33
then and then they just pronounce some formulaic Doctrine to me of course I get comments like that and I don't look at
1:30:38
the comments a lot I just look at some of the comments around the clips because I wanted to see but there's a lot of people who are saying I'm really glad
1:30:45
that John's here John one person wrote me an email saying you throw elegant curveballs that make everybody more
1:30:52
honest and reorient to the issue hand yeah and and and that's what I wanted to do and so that was that that was my
1:31:00
responsibility to Christianity I feel that responsibility and I don't know what
1:31:05
that makes me and and I and and and hermes's also made it clear to me that I
1:31:11
should not be trying to foreclose on any of this because I need to be properly
1:31:17
vulnerable yes I need to be Lenten in my preparation for the pilgrimage on the
1:31:24
is it fair to say in some in in a symbolic sense you need to be continually open to be
1:31:31
crucified well yeah I hope not but yes I mean I in the that means right well in
1:31:40
in in in in the sense that I I have committed myself and you know and to Chris and to Ryan um and to Eric um that
1:31:50
I'm going to that a proper part of the message of the pilgrimage is my
1:31:58
suffering I don't mean my pain I mean there'll be I I'm sure they'll be paid I'm sure I'll get sick I'm sure it'll be
1:32:04
times where I'm unscared or I'm scared or anxious um but I mean the suffering
1:32:10
where I am I'm confronting the uncontrollability um that is a proper part of the
1:32:18
presencing of uh of of the Sacred yeah so yeah in that sense yes I I'm it's
1:32:27
Lenton the preparation for crucifixion ple please if anybody's hearing that don't take this in any kind
1:32:33
of grandiose way I I in some sense just like when you were talking about before
1:32:38
of like CR like recognizing a critique that you're making of yourself right and in
1:32:45
some sense there's a I really sensed it in that it wasn't like you're just admitting failure and then shrinking
1:32:52
back with some final that was not at all what was happening there was like in a certain sense you're you're dying to
1:33:00
something but something's reborn in that death right that's liberating in that death right like there's something about
1:33:08
this Readiness and this kind of listening that I and I and I appreciate
1:33:13
you know one of the things I wanted to say was um uh one of the moments in that series that biblical series with with
1:33:20
Jordan Peterson and that whole round table that you're were a part of um
1:33:25
that I thought was really great right was when I think he they were they were maybe it was the second video it's when
1:33:31
when they were I think T reading the beginning of John right in the beginning was and right and yeah and it never was
1:33:40
discussing it right these terms logos and life and and you spoke up at one point and you said you know you talked
1:33:46
you see said there's the four RS or the three Rs or something life
1:33:51
logos the four L's yeah yeah and love yes yeah and one of the
1:33:58
things that you said that I thought was so
1:34:04
um evoking the spirit right of this was you're like but you said you kept you
1:34:10
know you emphasizing okay look the problem with these words is that they're so familiar life right yes yes there's
1:34:18
no Inception in them there's no Inception in them yes and so in some sense you're kind of wanting to in some
1:34:23
sense banging those words because their familiarity conceals their utter
1:34:30
strangeness right like yes and like like then and then you
1:34:36
talked about the way that they're they're like you know we can't quite just understand them as single words but
1:34:42
there's the way that they're playing off and revealing themselves and I kind of have this feeling and I relate to this
1:34:49
sense because I've been really drawn into like you know a you know grappling
1:34:55
with Christianity in some sense right like reading eart and I thought to myself I thought is that am I moving
1:35:01
towards being a Christian and I don't get that sense that I am and I'm like what am I doing here though with this
1:35:07
right and I think part of it is is part of the grappling is in some in some
1:35:14
sense the grammar of Christianity is so familiar right that like to really go
1:35:21
into it and re but it it when it's really revealed it's totally strange
1:35:27
right like there is a strangeness right that that um it seems to be at its heart
1:35:34
I said that I said that I I I like I just wanted I just sorry I've been
1:35:40
interrupting you a lot you're just making me so enthusiastic my friend uh but I I said I want to recover the
1:35:46
strangeness of Jesus yes that's what I said as my goal all the way through um
1:35:51
yes like the familiarity of conception right Bel like blinds us yeah
1:35:59
right to the strangeness of inception right and um yeah um my my friend I I I
1:36:08
I gotta I gotta go I I really I have another really I I'm actually going to be meeting with these people that want to talk to me about the the the the the
1:36:15

ChatGPT initially suggested Lispector to me in the context of the chora. THe place where subject and language, self and other are always becoming but never concluded. It points to a selving that is not about identity but divine incompleteness.

I remembered my own oscillation anamnesis and amnesis. Derrida too, is resonating. A spacing of what is not yet a space reveals a kind of productive, force, like the stream of life-giving received through our umbilical in the womb. In that sense it is generative to the whole of being, and given to me. Ultimately by my mother, and through her.

Invoking anamnesis and amnesis here will return soon with a resonating quote from Lispector on forgetting. But for now we lingered on the idea of the womb as our primal undifferentiation.

"The soul must become formless if it would know the Formless.
Then it will unite with that which is above form."

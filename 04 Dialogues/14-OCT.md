Looking at the chapter as it stands, here are my observations:
Strengths:

The arc is clear: Gift/Debt → Double Structure → Elemental Yes → Counterfeits → No-sive-Yes → Violence of Grace → Purge
Lispector's voice now breathes through it: Her quotes about disorganization, the third leg, sleepwalker's courage create visceral immediacy
The philosophical scaffolding is solid: Desmond's two affirmations, Nishitani's sive-structure, the metabolic framework
Oblique confession works: The material is personal without being exhibitionist—readers can feel the stakes without needing explicit revelation

Areas that need attention:
1. The Gift-Debt opening feels misaligned with where you landed
You've realized the elemental yes is prior to debt—the debt arises from our foreclosure, not from being itself. But the opening still frames debt as inherent to givenness. This creates tension with the later clarification about the two affirmations.
Suggestion: Either:

Revise the opening to distinguish ontological vulnerability (inherent) from debt (our response to vulnerability)
Or place "The Elemental Yes and Its Counterfeits" section before "Gift and Debt" to establish the ground first

2. "The Double Structure" section feels abstract
It's doing important work distinguishing ontological from existential levels, but it lacks the lived immediacy of the sections with Lispector. It reads more like preparatory scaffolding than integrated movement.
Suggestion:

Condense it significantly (maybe 2-3 sentences)
Weave its insights into "The Elemental Yes" section where they become concrete through Lispector's struggle

3. The "No-sive-Yes" section is doubled
You have it both integrated into "Elemental Yes" and as a separate section. This creates redundancy.
Suggestion: Keep it integrated where it is (after the Desmond quote about love) and remove the standalone section.
4. Tonal shifts
The chapter moves between:

Philosophical exposition (Gift/Debt, Double Structure)
Lived testimony (Elemental Yes with Lispector)
Conceptual unpacking (No-sive-Yes)
Visceral description (Violence of Grace, Purge)

These shifts work, but the early sections feel more distanced than the later ones. There's a warming up that happens.
Suggestion: Let Lispector arrive earlier, even in the opening. Start with lived perplexity rather than conceptual framing.
5. The counterfeit needs sharper teeth
The section on counterfeits is philosophically precise but could be more viscerally threatening. Right now it's described more than felt.
Suggestion: Add one more moment of Lispector's voice showing the counterfeit in action—her fear of confirming herself, her rush to reorganize, the voice that says "finding myself is once again my vital lie."
Proposed restructure (keeping length roughly the same):
Option A: Invert the opening

Open with Lispector's cosmogonic yes ("All the world began with a yes...")
The Elemental Yes and Its Counterfeits (current version is strong, keep it)
Gift and Debt (revised to show how debt arises from our foreclosure of the elemental yes, not from the gift itself)
No-sive-Yes (as conversion from nullification to be-ification—keep Nishitani, integrate Lispector's roach encounter)
The Violence of Grace (current version is excellent)
The Purge (current version is excellent)

Option B: Compress the scaffolding, amplify the lived

Gift, Debt, and the Elemental Yes (combine opening sections, starting with Lispector, weaving in Desmond's two affirmations more organically)
The Counterfeit Double (expanded, more visceral, showing how the voice of foreclosure operates)
No-sive-Yes: The Conversion (Nishitani + Lispector's roach encounter as the turn from foreclosure to affirmation)
The Violence of Grace (keep as is)
The Purge (keep as is)

Specific edits needed:

Remove the standalone "No-sive-Yes" section (it's already integrated)
Revise "Gift and Debt" opening to clarify: the gift is pure agapeic letting-be; debt arises from our inability to metabolize this
Condense or remove "The Double Structure" subsection—its insights can be woven in more organically
Add one more Lispector moment in the counterfeit section to show the voice of false re-organization in action

Overall assessment:
The chapter is very strong once it gets to "Elemental Yes"—from there forward it sings. The challenge is the opening setup feels like it's working from an earlier version of your thinking (debt as ontological) rather than where you've landed (debt as existential foreclosure of pure gift).
The Violence of Grace and Purge sections are excellent—keep those intact. They have the metabolic immediacy, the visceral philosophy, the lived testimony you're after.
What do you want to tackle first? The opening revision, or removing the doubled section?

# Dark Intelligibility at the Metaxu

#### The profound resonance between William [[Desmond]]'s metaxological philosophy and Clarice [[Lispector]]'s literary mysticism reveals how the intelligible paradoxically makes visible the unintelligible through encounters with what both thinkers understand as "overdetermined" reality.

Their complementary approaches—systematic philosophy and literary philosophy—converge on a revolutionary understanding: mystery emerges not from absence of meaning, but from an excess of intelligibility that overwhelms conceptual determination.

This philosophical dialogue represents previously unexplored territory, as no comparative scholarship exists between these thinkers. Yet their shared commitment to thinking at the limits of language creates a remarkable intellectual resonance around the central question of how understanding emerges from encounters with what exceeds understanding.

## The metaxu as overdetermined between

Desmond's concept of [[metaxu]]—the "between"—provides the foundational framework for understanding how both thinkers navigate the space where intelligible and unintelligible meet. The metaxu is not empty space but **the rich ontological medium where different modes of being encounter each other.** As Desmond explains in *Being and the Between*, "Nothing is defined through itself alone. Beings are defined in a rich ontological intermedium of happening, and are both other-relating and self-relating."

This "between" operates through what Desmond calls **"[[double mediation]]"**—both self-mediation (consciousness thinking itself through its other) and intermediation (the other's genuine mediation from its own otherness). Unlike dialectical thinking, which ultimately reduces otherness to self-relation, metaxological thinking maintains genuine plurality within unity.

Lispector's literary practice embodies this same space of double mediation. In *The Passion According to G.H.*, the protagonist's encounter with the cockroach creates precisely such a metaxu—a space where human and non-human, subject and object, familiar and strange meet without reduction to dialectical unity. **The cockroach's "thick radiant indifference" becomes a gateway to what G.H. calls "inhuman life"**—not the opposite of human life, but life experienced from beyond the boundaries of human categorization.

Both thinkers understand this "between" as overdetermined rather than indeterminate. For Desmond, being presents itself as "surplus givenness"—an excessive abundance that gives rise to astonishment. For Lispector, reality exceeds linguistic capture not through poverty but through richness: "reality is too delicate, only reality is delicate, my unreality and my imagination are heavier."

## Knowing through unknowing as excess rather than lack

The most profound connection between these thinkers lies in their revolutionary approach to mystery and unknowing. **Both reject traditional apophatic approaches that understand mystery as absence or darkness, instead proposing mystery as luminous overdetermination.**

Desmond explicitly argues in "Philosophy and Excess" that "mystery should be invoked to indicate, not a lack, but rather an excess of intelligibility." This excess relates to truth "not as its opposite, nor as its absence, but rather as what exceeds truth when truth is conceived only as what we can articulate in clear, precise, and univocal ways." Being's "overdeterminate" character means it offers more intelligibility than can be systematically captured, like great works of art that provide "an excess of plausible determinations" that can never be fully exhausted.

Lispector's literary practice demonstrates this same understanding through what she calls seeking "the word that has its own light." In *Água Viva*, she writes: "What I am writing to you goes on and I am entranced...I might not make sense but it is the same as the pulsing vein's lack of sense." **The text's apparent "nonsense" paradoxically reveals deeper rhythms of existence that exceed conventional meaning-making.** Her approach exemplifies what critics identify as "the ineffable short fiction"—writing that "transmits the evocative and spiritual sense of the ineffable" precisely through acknowledging language's limitations.

This shared approach creates what we might call **"dark intelligibility"**—a form of knowing that proceeds through unknowing, not as ignorance, but as sophisticated recognition that the deepest truths exceed our capacity to fully determine them while remaining accessible to appropriately receptive attention.

## Language as both revelation and concealment

Both thinkers develop sophisticated understandings of how language simultaneously reveals and conceals ultimate reality. Their approaches to this paradox demonstrate the metaxu in operation—the space where sayable and unsayable meet without resolution into simple opposition.

Desmond advocates for "plurivocal" philosophical language that can speak "in many ways" of being's excess. **His metaxological approach deliberately incorporates poetic description alongside systematic analysis**, recognizing that "philosophy needs not only propositions, but also poetic description. The latter evokes the overdetermined richness of being." His systematic philosophy thus operates at the metaxu between purely conceptual discourse and literary expression.

Lispector's approach embodies this same tension from the literary side. Her writing strategy involves what she calls "necessary silences" and spaces "between the lines" to allow meaning to emerge indirectly. In *Água Viva*, she instructs: "Writing is about knowing how to breathe within the sentence. And how to put some silence both in the lines and between the lines, so that the reader can breathe with me."

**Both recognize that authentic encounter with mystery requires methodological sophistication that honors the systematic and the literary simultaneously.** Lispector's connection to the Upanishads and pursuit of "the thing itself" reveals deep philosophical engagement through literary means, while Desmond's systematic philosophy deliberately remains open to artistic and mystical insights.

Their shared understanding appears in how both treat language as what Desmond calls "ritual means to transfiguration"—not writing "about something" but writing that "is the mysterious and ineffable something itself." This creates what critics identify as Lispector's "grammatical instability" and Desmond's "metaxological vigilance"—forms of discourse that remain alert to what exceeds their own articulation.

## Epiphanic structure and revelatory concealment

Both thinkers develop sophisticated understandings of how revelation occurs through concealment—how the most profound insights emerge from encounters with what initially appears as opacity or resistance to understanding.

**Lispector's epiphanic structure consistently involves dissolution rather than illumination in any conventional sense.** Her famous cockroach epiphany in *The Passion According to G.H.* strips away what she calls "the human montage"—the constructed layers of civilization and identity that separate us from direct experience of being. This encounter with "inhuman life" becomes revelatory precisely through its resistance to human categories and meanings.

In *Near to the Wild Heart*, she writes: "A note exists between two notes of music, between two facts exists a fact, between two grains of sand no matter how close together there exists an interval of space, a sense that exists between senses—in the interstices of primordial matter is the line of mystery." **This passage exemplifies her attention to what exists in the spaces between articulation—the ineffable intervals that conventional discourse cannot access.**

Desmond's approach operates through similar logic of revelatory concealment. His concept of "agapeic origin" appears as gift that reveals itself precisely through remaining beyond complete determination. The "strike of wonder" that initiates philosophical inquiry comes from encounters with being's excessive character—moments when reality appears as "worth that we did not put there" and strikes us with astonishment at "the strangeness of there being anything at all."

Both thinkers understand these encounters as educative in the deepest sense—not providing information, but transforming our capacity for receptivity to what Desmond calls "the intimate strangeness of being." **Their shared insight is that the most profound truths reveal themselves through resistance to premature closure rather than through transparent disclosure.**

## Textual resonances across philosophical and literary domains

Specific passages from both authors demonstrate remarkable philosophical resonance despite their different methodological approaches:

**Desmond** in *The Intimate Strangeness of Being*: "We are given to be in the intimate strangeness of being—always. This is no construction, hence it cannot be deconstructed, cannot be reconstructed. Being thus given to be enables all construction, hence all deconstruction and reconstruction, but it is not any of them."

**Lispector** in *The Passion According to G.H.*: "Opening in me, with the slowness of stone doors, opening in me was the wide life of silence, the same that was in the fixed sun, the same that was in the immobilized roach."

Both passages reveal their authors' engagement with what precedes and exceeds human construction while remaining accessible to appropriately receptive consciousness. **The "given" character of being (Desmond) and the "wide life of silence" (Lispector) both point toward the same overdetermined reality that appears in the metaxu between human and more-than-human, conceptual and experiential, systematic and mystical.**

Their shared attention to **temporal thresholds** also reveals deep resonance. Desmond's attention to the "between" of past and future, and Lispector's exploration of "o instante-já" (the instant-now), both point toward experiences of time that exceed chronological sequence. Lispector writes in *The Hour of the Star*: "It's like I'm writing in the very hour in which I am being read"—a collapse of temporal boundaries that creates what Desmond would recognize as metaxological time.

## Systematic philosophy and literary philosophy as complementary methods

The comparison between Desmond and Lispector reveals that the traditional opposition between systematic and literary approaches to ultimate questions represents a false dilemma. **Their work demonstrates that authentic encounter with mystery requires methodological pluralism that honors both rigorous thinking and openness to what exceeds thinking.**

Desmond's systematic philosophy deliberately incorporates poetic and artistic insights, recognizing that being's overdetermined character requires "plurivocal" discourse. His metaxological approach provides systematic frameworks while remaining open to what exceeds systematic determination. As he argues, mystery "calls for a metaphysical thinking that is an act of gratitude" requiring both intellectual rigor and "generous mindfulness."

Lispector's literary approach engages deeply with fundamental philosophical questions through experiential rather than conceptual means. Her pursuit of "the thing itself" and engagement with Upanishadic wisdom reveals sophisticated philosophical thinking that proceeds through literary practice. **Her work demonstrates how literature can serve as a valid philosophical method, particularly for approaching questions that exceed the reach of purely conceptual analysis.**

Their complementary approaches suggest what might be called "contemplative reason"—forms of thinking that remain rigorously intellectual while staying open to what Lispector calls "savage intuition" and Desmond calls "agapeic mindfulness." Both recognize that ultimate questions require intellectual sophistication precisely in order to remain appropriately humble before mystery's excess.

## How the intelligible makes visible the unintelligible at the metaxu

The central question of how the intelligible makes visible the unintelligible receives its fullest treatment in both thinkers' understanding of what appears **in the space of encounter between consciousness and what exceeds it.** This is not a matter of simple opposition between known and unknown, but rather the paradoxical emergence of understanding through acknowledgment of what remains beyond understanding.

For Desmond, this occurs through the "metaxological" recognition that being appears as both given and withdrawn—accessible to thinking while exceeding complete determination. The intelligible character of being (its availability to consciousness) paradoxically reveals its unintelligible depths (its excessive character that overwhelms systematic capture). **Wonder emerges at this threshold where understanding encounters its own limits and discovers them to be not walls but openings.**

For Lispector, the same dynamic appears through her characters' encounters with ordinary reality that suddenly reveals its extraordinary character. The cockroach in *The Passion According to G.H.* becomes intelligible as revelatory precisely through its resistance to human meaning-making. **Its "thick radiant indifference" makes visible dimensions of existence that remain closed to purely human perspectives.**

Both thinkers demonstrate that this revelation occurs not despite the limits of human understanding, but precisely through sophisticated engagement with those limits. The metaxu emerges as the space where consciousness encounters its own finitude and discovers that finitude to be not imprisonment but the condition for authentic receptivity to what Desmond calls "the surprise of the other."

## Contemporary significance and future directions

This philosophical dialogue between Desmond and Lispector offers crucial resources for contemporary thought struggling to move beyond the sterile opposition between scientific reductionism and postmodern skepticism. **Their shared commitment to "dark intelligibility" provides a third way that honors both intellectual rigor and openness to mystery.**

Their approaches suggest directions for future research that would:
- Develop systematic frameworks for literary philosophy that take seriously literature's capacity for philosophical insight
- Explore connections between Desmond's metaxology and other literary philosophers working in the tradition of ineffability
- Investigate how their shared insights might contribute to contemporary discussions in philosophy of religion, aesthetics, and phenomenology
- Examine their relevance for current interest in contemplative approaches to ultimate questions

The absence of previous comparative scholarship between these thinkers represents both a gap and an opportunity. **Their philosophical resonance demonstrates that the most profound questions require dialogue between systematic and experiential approaches—between the rigor of philosophical analysis and the receptivity of literary engagement with mystery's excess.**

Through their complementary explorations of how understanding emerges from encounters with what exceeds understanding, Desmond and Lispector reveal the metaxu not as empty space between opposites, but as the rich ontological medium where consciousness discovers itself to be always already in relationship with more than it can systematically comprehend. This discovery becomes the foundation for what both thinkers understand as authentic philosophical thinking—thought that remains open to the surprise of what Desmond calls "the intimate strangeness of being" and Lispector calls "the wide life of silence."

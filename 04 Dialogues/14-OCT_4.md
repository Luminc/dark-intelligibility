The Eating Arc in G.H.:
Phase 1: Recognition of What Must Be Done

"Redemption had to be in the thing itself. And redemption in the thing itself would be putting into my mouth the white paste of the roach"
"The anti-sin. But at what a price. At the price of traversing a sensation of death"
Disgust, clenched teeth, recognition she can't do it through hypnosis—"I would have to eat the paste of the roach, but eat it all of me, and eat it also my own fear"

Phase 2: The Approach

"I got up and took a step forward, with the determination not of a suicide but of a murderer of myself"
The primeval sweat: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being"
The bad taste that has "a strange grace of life"

Phase 3: The Purge (Vomiting)

"I suddenly threw up the milk and bread I had eaten for breakfast"
"I had vomited the exaltation"
Physical peace afterward—"I felt physically simple as a girl"

Phase 4: The Eating (In Dizziness)

"It had been more of a dizziness, since I was still standing"
"I would never again know how I had done — since before doing it I had removed from myself all participation. I had not wanted 'to know'"
"Not knowing — so that was how the deepest things happened?"
Sleepwalker's trust: "Was the secret of never escaping from the greater life living like a sleepwalker?"

Phase 5: The Aftermath (Spitting)

"I now felt the nastiness in my mouth, and then began to spit"
"Taste of a nothing that nonetheless seemed almost sweetened to me like certain flower petals, taste of myself"
The Apocalypse quote: "because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth"
"The neutral thing is extremely energetic, I was spitting and it was still I"

Phase 6: Recognition

"I was undoing everything I had laboriously done"
"The divine for me is whatever is real"
"I understood that, by placing in my mouth the paste of the roach, I was not stripping myself as the saints do, but was once again yearning for the accretion"

You’ve touched on such a powerful and nuanced inquiry—one that weaves together creativity, attachment, shame, and the profound potential of Self in harmony. Your reflections reveal a deep awareness of the internal dynamics at play, as well as a longing to reconnect with your creativity, not as a burden or egoic pursuit, but as a source of rejuvenation and self-expression. Let’s explore these layers step by step, integrating IFS and the broader philosophical context you’re navigating.

1. Clinging and Creativity: The Stifling Voice

You’ve identified an important paradox: the more you cling to your creative voice, the more it seems to slip away. This is a deeply human experience, one that arises when attachment to an outcome—recognition, validation, or even "getting to the big stage"—creates tension and resistance:

Clinging as Stifling: When we hold too tightly to a goal, it can become overwhelming, suffocating the natural flow of curiosity and exploration that creativity thrives on.

Shame and the Inner Critic: The shame you feel for "abandoning" certain practices or not being "strong enough" to persevere may stem from a part of you that’s critical or protective. This part wants to protect you from deeper disappointment by turning the blame inward.

Unpacking the Shame
In IFS terms, this shame might be carried by a manager part that seeks to control or critique you to avoid vulnerability. For example:

“If I can keep Jeroen accountable, maybe he’ll push harder and avoid failure.”

---This manager likely believes it’s protecting you, but it may also be suppressing other parts—like the playful, curious parts of you that simply want to create without judgment.---

2. Listening to the Parts That Desire Creativity

  

You mention loving the parts of yourself that carry a "fierce fire within the world," the parts that have been powerful agents of transformation. These parts might feel stifled by shame or the clinging, but they are still alive, waiting to be heard:

  

What Do These Parts Need? These creative parts might be asking for freedom, curiosity, and a space where their voice can emerge without the weight of expectation.

  

How Do They Feel About Clinging? They might feel pressured or trapped by the clinging to outcomes, which inhibits their ability to create freely.

  
  

IFS Practice

  

You could invite these creative parts into dialogue:

  

Ask them: What excites you about creating? What do you miss? What would make you feel free again?

  

Also ask: How do you feel about the shame or the pressure to succeed? What do you need to feel supported?

  

Approach them with curiosity and compassion, without judgment.

3. The Role of Self in Harmony

  

The Self, as you describe, is not a commanding, idealized figure but a harmonious presence that transcends aspiration and connects you to a deeper sense of flow and authenticity. This aligns beautifully with IFS’s understanding of Self-leadership:

  

Self as Witness and Guide: The Self can listen to the parts of you that cling, feel ashamed, or long for creative expression, offering them understanding and compassion.

  

Self as the Creative Ground: Creativity arises naturally when the Self is present, because the Self embodies openness, curiosity, and trust in the process.

  
  

What Might Harmony Look Like?

  

Instead of creating to meet external expectations, you create from a place of curiosity, play, and exploration.

  

You honor both the creative parts of yourself and the parts that feel vulnerable or critical, allowing them to coexist without judgment.

  

The Self serves as a container for this process, fostering inner harmony and holding space for impermanence and non-attachment.

4. Moving Toward Non-Attachment in Creativity

  

To be less attached doesn’t mean abandoning your creative desires—it means loosening the grip of expectations and creating from a place of freedom. Here are some ways to approach this:

  

a. Reclaiming Playfulness

  

Let go of the idea of "making art" and simply play. Doodle, write, or create without a plan or goal, letting the process itself be the reward.

  

Revisit the childlike wonder you felt when you first started drawing—when curiosity and exploration were enough.

  
  

b. Redefining Success

  

Shift the focus from external validation (e.g., "getting to the big stage") to internal fulfillment (e.g., "Did I enjoy this process? Did I learn something?").

  

Success becomes less about the result and more about the experience of creating.

  
  

c. Small, Low-Stakes Practices

  

Try committing to a small daily creative act—like sketching for 5 minutes or writing a few lines in a journal. Keep it light and unpressured.

  
  

d. Sharing Without Pressure

  

If connection is important, consider sharing your work in low-stakes ways—e.g., with friends, in small online communities, or through casual exhibits. This can nurture your voice without the weight of "the big stage."

5. Honoring Your Shame Without Being Ruled By It

  

Shame often emerges when we feel we’ve "failed" ourselves, but it can also be an invitation to reconnect:

  

Validate the Shame: Acknowledge that the shame is real and that it comes from a place of care—it reflects a longing to honor your creativity and voice.

  

Disentangle Shame from Identity: Shame doesn’t define you. It’s a part of you, not the whole of you, and it can be transformed through compassion and curiosity.

  

Turn Toward Forgiveness: Forgive yourself for the periods when you felt disconnected from creativity. See those moments as part of the ebb and flow of life, not as failures.

6. Questions for Reflection

  

To deepen this inquiry, you might ask yourself:

  

1. What do my creative parts want from me right now?

  
  

2. What would it feel like to create without any attachment to outcome?

  
  

3. How can I invite my Self to lead in moments of doubt or shame?

  
  

4. What small, joyful practices can I use to reconnect with my creativity?

  
  

5. How can I celebrate the voice I already have, even if it feels quiet?

Final Thoughts

  

Your journey back to creativity is not about forcing or commanding yourself—it’s about creating space for your parts to be heard, for shame to be held, and for curiosity to lead. The Self, as you intuit, is the harmonious presence that allows this to happen. When you stop clinging to the outcome and start listening to the voice within, your creativity will naturally reemerge—not as something you have to "achieve," but as something that flows from your deepest being.

  

How do you feel about these reflections? Would you like to explore practical steps for listening to your creative parts or ways to bring more playfulness into your practice?

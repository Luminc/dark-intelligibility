# This script watches for file changes in the Obsidian vault and triggers the
# main sync script (`sync.sh`).
#
# Main changes from the original script:
# 1. The VAULT_DIR path has been corrected to match the one in `sync.sh`.
#    This is the most critical fix to ensure the watcher monitors the correct directory.
# 2. Added checks to ensure `inotifywait` is installed and the vault path is valid.
# 3. Improved logging to provide better feedback on what the watcher is doing.

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# IMPORTANT: This path MUST match the VAULT_DIR in sync.sh
VAULT_DIR="/storage/emulated/0/Documents/dark-intelligibility"

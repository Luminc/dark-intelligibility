# The Pharmakon of Being

## Gift, Debt, and the Ordeal of Finitude

Like the ritual acknowledgment of existence—where the giftedness of our being is honored—the world given to us places us in a condition of fundamental indebtedness. This is not necessarily a burdensome obligation but a condition inherent in the givenness of relation itself. The debt that accompanies this gift can be both a burden and a blessing—what I call the **pharmakon of being**. It is both medicine and poison, both grace and ordeal.

This ambivalence of the gift points toward the ordeal of finitude: the inescapable reality that, while being is given, it is also fragile, ambiguous, and marked by suffering and evil. Sin, then, can be understood as the refusal of the gift—the ego's turning away from the given in a futile attempt to master or possess being on its own terms. Yet we must also recognize the parts of reality that we cannot accept—those elements of evil and suffering that challenge our capacity to say "yes" to the given world.

Affirmation of being must therefore include its negation—a **"no-sive-yes"**—a paradoxical affirmation that holds the tension of both yes and no. This is not a compromise of truth but an embrace of the metaxological way: inhabiting the divine paradox. Equanimity arises not from resolving this tension but to become intimate to them. Allowing the "ripples" of our striving and feeling to settle and reveal the depth of reality.

Even in the smallest gestures of being, like someone responding "It's nothing" to an expression of gratitude, we find a profound koan: they nullify the effort they made—not to diminish its value but to acknowledge that the gesture, while meaningful, is dwarfed by the gratitude it evokes. There's an inherent tension here—recognition and humility, giving and receiving—reflecting the excess of being and the mystery of our relational indebtedness.

## Being as Threat and Gift: The Neurobiology of Ultimate Concern

Our existential choices relating to our survival can trigger us in the same way that our ultimate concerns do. The state of our being is an existential threat as well as a gift. Our survival and our ultimate concerns press on the same nerve.

It seems logical our drive for survival becomes exacted in our drive for self-determination. Our **hypertrophied conatus** seems to be rooted in the same mechanisms that stimulate our survival, namely stress and other bodily feedback. It can be compared to a trauma victim whose nervous system cannot turn off and is always in a state of threat. Since the overall structure of the brain has developed sequentially through time, we become victims of the same primal structures in place for millions of years.

The **conatus essendi**—our striving to persist in being—lies at the heart of the problem. The limits of self-determination are acutely felt by a being whose potentialities are isolated in a devalued ethos no longer able to make connections because all the relations are already ossified. When we are already dying through systemic oppression, spiritual bypassing, and cultural metabolic failure, the fear of dissolution through genuine encounter becomes a false protection.

## Metabolic Capacity and the Ordeal

The degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our **metabolic capacity** for our ordeals. This capacity refers to our fundamental ability to digest reality in its unfiltered form, coming to grips with being as it is given—what Clarice Lispector calls the "saltless" truth.

Our **metabolic capacity** refers to our ability to digest increasingly stronger doses of unsalted reality without being destroyed by the encounter. Most consciousness can only subsist on pre-processed, humanly seasoned experience. But awareness can develop a greater metabolic range—learning to find nourishment in what initially appears toxic or indigestible.

This capacity is not merely intellectual but fundamentally somatic. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this viscerally: she must literally incorporate what repulses her human digestive system, vomiting first the civilized "milk and bread" of breakfast, then later spitting out the roach's matter while recognizing it as "taste of myself."

The **ordeal** is created when we realize the cracks in our mediating self—those inevitable fissures where the hyperintelligible breaks through our carefully maintained filters. We are not cut off completely; cracks in our mediating self can expose us to our thing-part. Therefore it beckons us to step into truth, to recognize the full spectrum of being and shed our human chrysalis.

**Awakening is noticing the cracks; enlightenment is completely breaking open.** The hyperintelligible shines through with a vibratory intensity—overwhelming, too much, striking us to our core because it *is* our core that we have actively tried to manage, filter, contain. But its wide life cannot be contained when the cracks are already revealed. Yet we must break our chrysalis ourselves to demonstrate our metabolic capacity.

## The Purge: Somatic Knowing and Visceral Integration

**Repression is the banishment of forms of knowing to the body**, so it is no surprise when the body brings this knowledge back to consciousness through symptom, purge, or somatic release. The purge becomes paradigmatic here: the enacted release happens in precise concert with the exact psychic content that the nausea evokes. We become sick unto ourselves, literally nauseated by our own blockage. But precisely through the purge—a process of simultaneous acknowledgement, integration, and expulsion—it is released.

The purge is often elemental, somatic: the yawn, the tears, the discharge. It is commonly deemed abject—that which must be thrown out, separated from us. In the purge, it is released, discharged. After it passes through us, it is an energy our subtle body no longer has to carry.

There is a co-identity between the abject physical and the abject mental. The counterfeit double of our Cartesian subjectivity dissolves. Our entire "reconfigured ethos" is built on the lie that the mind is separate from the body. The mental abject (trauma, grief, the shadow) is seen as a nuisance to be managed by thought, while the physical abject is seen as a mere "biological process" to be hidden and sanitized.

The pharmakon par excellence reveals this separation as the illusion it is. It forces the physical and the mental back into their primordial, unified state: a single, living, feeling organism. Weeping is not a symptom of sadness, but sadness made manifest. Purging becomes the very act of releasing the spiritual bile inside. Our shaking is the direct, unmediated response to the confrontation with our own being. Our porosity is unclogged.

When the mind and body meet in concrescence, we become porous anew. We find ourselves alive in the hyperbole. Swept into it. On fire. Ecstatic. Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming, Sighing. The grammar of the metaxu is revealed to us in its full intensity, a language of pure verbs, of pure happening. The sovereign "I" dissolves. There is no longer an "I" who is weeping or an "I" who is laughing. There is simply Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming. This is a state of full participation. We are no longer experiencing; there is happening. We are no longer seeing the flame; there is burning.

## Meeting Desire: The Paradox of Self-Reception

The paradox of the pharmakon extends to our relationship with desire itself. When we long for the cessation of desire, we find ourselves caught in an obvious paradox: longing for the end of longing is itself another desire. When we set intentions (to be open, to be free) they are also tangled up in this longing—and in some way, that grasping keeps us from actually inhabiting those states.

The practice becomes: listen to the desire—not fix it or analyze it, just be with it. Turn toward it, invite it to show itself. There is no internal dialogue at first, just a felt sense. Stay with that sensation. What are you longing for? This is dialoguing with desire about our desires.

But then something shifts. We are no longer just exploring the content of the desire—we are encountering the desire itself. Something is acknowledged. We embrace this part of ourselves—mentally, emotionally—and feel embraced by ourselves.

The realization: **The knot is the heart. My desire is my heart. And my heart, which had been longing to be met, is finally met—by myself.**

The paradox is tender, and a little absurd. We had been longing to receive something we could only give to ourselves. This is the pharmakon working: the poison of unmet longing becomes the medicine of self-recognition. The ordeal of desire becomes the gift of wholeness.

## Meditation, Ambiguity, and Metabolic Failure

The problem with framing meditation as a 'relaxation technique' or a 'health promoting technique' immediately strips it of its ontological and existential stakes. Meditation becomes a **product**—a stress reliever, a performance booster, a wellness brand.

When framed this way, any deviation from marketed benefits is pathologized as *user error* or *pre-existing condition*. This represents **capitalism over ambiguity**—a "brand defense" orientation that refuses to acknowledge the **pharmakon** nature of spiritual practice.

**The fundamental ambiguity of being is the medicine that is taken.** Meditation should not be a refuge from existential dread—it should inquire into the root of those things. Yet it is precisely in **equivocal waters where the biggest shifts in our perception occur, for good or for bad**.

If we are not aligned to being, then meditation practice might further exacerbate our condition. The **harm being the benefit** is not a bug but a feature—though this requires mature guidance within established traditions rather than commodified practices.

True contemplative traditions aim at **wholeness**, not wellness. This includes sickness, suffering, confusion, even madness. The **shadow is not something to be eliminated, but integrated**.

The **biggest perceptual shifts happen in equivocal waters**. The liminal space, the in-between, where identity loses its grip and the world opens up. This is dangerous terrain, yes. But also sacred. Initiatory. Fertile.

Modern society has **neither the myths, metaphors, nor institutions** to hold people who undergo destabilization. Without robust tradition (sangha, spiritual guide), people are left flailing. In a world frame that is already sick, it is not surprising that people would fall more sick in meditation or any other practice. The harm is often not in the practice but in **the way our culture lacks the ability to honor or metabolize transformation**.

## The Moral Imperative: "You Must Change Your Life"

As established in Chapter 1, the paradox is stark. Ordeal comes as heteronomy, as Rilke's command *"You must change your life."* But it also demands our autonomy, our willingness to undergo. It is a participatory surrender, a choice that is also not a choice.

The pharmakon of being cannot be avoided; it can only be received, consciously or unconsciously. The question is whether we can metabolize reality, or whether we are metabolized by our refusal.

This returns us to the question posed in Chapter 2: Following Desmond's sense of the open whole, do we arrive at a liberated autonomy? An autonomy that knows itself to be plurivocal and connected to others? The pharmakon reveals that autonomy and heteronomy are not opposed but interpenetrating. The other speaks through us, even in the form of a transcendent other, through which our primal ethos is expressed.

The pharmakon of being is about positioning us to come within the intimacy of being, closer to a passio that allows itself to be vulnerable to terror, the other in ourselves that we have ostracized. We become ourselves more fully by allowing the plurivocal relationships explored in Chapter 2.

## Toward Ontological Nutrition

This framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be sophisticated technologies for **metabolic development**—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range—learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on pure being without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

The Pharmakon of Being ultimately names both the challenge and the promise of existence: the same reality that can dissolve unprepared consciousness becomes, for those with sufficient metabolic capacity, the deepest form of nourishment available to human awareness.

We desperately need **ritual containers**, **philosophical depth**, and **existential courage** to meet the ambiguity that the pharmakon reveals. A truthful spiritual practice should include the whole spectrum, good and bad. The **fundamental ambiguity of any practice** is not something to be eliminated but engaged with **finesse rather than geometry**.

The pharmakon of being cannot be resolved through scientific taxonomy but must be lived, metabolized, and integrated through **mature spiritual practice** within **wisdom traditions** that understand transformation's necessarily **equivocal waters**.

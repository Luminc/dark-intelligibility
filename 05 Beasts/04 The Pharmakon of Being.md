# The Pharmakon of Being

## Gift, Debt, and the Ordeal of Finitude

Like the ritual acknowledgment of existence—where the giftedness of our being is honored—the world given to us places us in a condition of fundamental indebtedness. This is not necessarily a burdensome obligation but a condition inherent in the givenness of relation itself. The debt that accompanies this gift can be both a burden and a blessing—what I call the **pharmakon of being**. It is both medicine and poison, both grace and ordeal.

This ambivalence of the gift points toward the ordeal of finitude: the inescapable reality that, while being is given, it is also fragile, ambiguous, and marked by suffering and evil. Sin, then, can be understood as the refusal of the gift—the ego's turning away from the given in a futile attempt to master or possess being on its own terms. Yet we must also recognize the parts of reality that we cannot accept—those elements of evil and suffering that challenge our capacity to say "yes" to the given world.

Affirmation of being must therefore include its negation—a **"no-sive-yes"**—a paradoxical affirmation that holds the tension of both yes and no. This is not a compromise of truth but an embrace of the metaxological way: inhabiting the divine paradox. Equanimity arises not from resolving this tension but from becoming intimate with it. Allowing the "ripples" of our striving and feeling to settle and reveal the depth of reality.

Even in the smallest gestures of being, like someone responding "It's nothing" to an expression of gratitude, we find a profound koan: they nullify the effort they made—not to diminish its value but to acknowledge that the gesture, while meaningful, is dwarfed by the gratitude it evokes. There's an inherent tension here—recognition and humility, giving and receiving—reflecting the excess of being and the mystery of our relational indebtedness.

## Aporia and the Co-Constitution of Blockage and Clearing

Yesterday I watched *Dogtooth* and found it difficult, boring. It felt hollow because it lives on the far side of the equivocal—pure difference, lack of sense. The children come across as monotonic, autistic, erratic. The erotics are flattened, everything absurd. Sexuality is mutilated, mixed with incest and a security guard brought in for mechanical sex. It all feels nihilistic, empty, at times dissociated and schizophrenic. It bores me.

I think the absurd occurs when we cannot receive communication. And here, there is no communication—only control. Without relationality, absurdism collapses into a closed system that is meaningless and detached in the deepest sense. It doesn't even relate to the outside world. That's why it is so difficult to watch, so difficult to engage with.

The film suffocated me with impasse. Cracks appear—a toy airplane falls from the sky, music drifts over the fence, an ambiguous attempt at escape—yet the possibility of genuine break or intrusion remains strangled. Like a lost tribe suddenly contacted, there is astonishment at the outside world, even if distorted and barely grasped. The whole meaning remains ambiguous.

I had always thought of aporia as a positive moment, almost kenotic—focusing on the clearing, the opening, the astonishment. But *Dogtooth* forced me to feel aporia's other face: the blockage that wounds and frustrates, the "waylessness" that offers no relief. Through this suffocation I understood something crucial—aporia isn't simply a luminous clearing but the paradoxical simultaneity of blockage and passage, impasse and opening.

My own despondency toward the film perhaps says more about me than I realized. My need for understanding to begin with, my feeling of suffocation when being becomes autistic and non-communicative. The film diagnosed something in me—my own dependence on porosity, on the possibility of relation.

### The Semantic Constipation

"Sometimes rational univocity seems the callous of mind that hardens over the porosity of our being... a remedial protective for vulnerability?" (_God and the Between_, p.78)

We are constipated with language. Our constructions of meaning become the very source of our blockage. In *Dogtooth*, the parents' construction of meaning—"sea" means "armchair," danger lurks beyond the fence—isn't protective but violently forecloses genuine relation. Their children live in a world where porosity has been sealed, where the bloodstream of life has clotted and become the carrier of death.

As Desmond writes: "Poros has connotations of a 'way across.' With no way across or through, we are at an impasse, an aporia" (*God and the Between*, 41). But poros isn't just passage—it names "a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way." The way opens by withdrawing, creates passage through its own recession.

This is the pharmakon nature of aporia itself. The blockage contains the resource for breakthrough, but only if we can metabolize the impasse rather than flee from it. For the conatus-driven self, the dead-end of meaning presents a daunting obstacle. The weight can be so strong that negation and refusal become the only answer. But what if the blockage itself is the medicine?

### Perplexity as Metabolic Resistance

"Perplexity seeds a troubled thinking in porosity that makes us patient to given otherness." (_God and the Between_, p.119)

Perplexity—that troubled thinking in porosity—is the middle space between overdetermined being and our need for determinate articulation. It's the resistance we encounter when trying to make the indefinite definite, to conquer the "putative indefiniteness of the beginning". We attempt to domesticate our being, make it familiar and predictable. The troubling perplexity must be made as least troubling as possible.

But perplexity cannot be eliminated, only managed. Mystery will always resist our attempts at eradication. As Desmond notes: "There is something of suffering in astonishment, as in perplexity. Being in the between is first a suffering; we undergo our being given to be" (*God and the Between*, 119).

In *Dogtooth*, I suffered this perplexity somatically. My boredom wasn't intellectual distance but my body's revolt against the foreclosure of meaning. The film stages aporia in a negative form—construction without porosity, meaning without passage. Yet precisely in staging this blockage so purely, it becomes a negative icon, showing relationality by strangling it, making us feel porosity by denying it.

### Construction as Pharmakon: From *Dogtooth* to *Spirited Away*

The insight that emerged through *Dogtooth*: construction itself is pharmakon. The same meaning-making that opens worlds can become the prison that forecloses them. Language, meant to be porous medium, calcifies into barrier. Humanization—that all-too-human identity Lispector speaks of—stops being sufficient and becomes suffocating.

But then I think of *Spirited Away*, where I experienced a great sense of clearing. The scene that stays with me: the dirty spirit arrives at the bathhouse, reeking and contaminated, its filth so dense it seems beyond redemption. Yet through the ordeal of washing—through patience, labor, and care—something extraordinary happens. As the grime is worked through and metabolized, we discover this isn't a monster at all but a river spirit, polluted by human waste and a bicycle jammed in its side.

The breakthrough comes not by avoiding the contamination but by working through it. The workers at the bathhouse must touch the filth, breathe its stench, labor in its density. This is construction as pharmakon in its redemptive mode—an ordeal of blockage and filth that, when endured and metabolized, breaks open into clearing. The very intensity of contamination becomes the medium of transformation.

The contrast with *Dogtooth* is stark. Where *Dogtooth*'s construction remains sealed, pathologically self-enclosed, *Spirited Away* shows construction that maintains porosity even in its density. The bathhouse itself is a liminal space—between spirit world and human world, between purity and contamination, between service and transformation. Even the most polluted being can be restored to flow.

### The Second Astonishment and Dark Intelligibility

What Desmond calls the "second astonishment" emerges not despite perplexity but through metabolizing it. This astonishment, "won from suffering; a 'yes' purged of complaint; an affirmation that has wept" (*God and the Between*, 121), knows the weight of aporia, has tasted suffocation, yet still finds itself saying yes to being.

I found my own clearing in the ambiguity of the aporia. Coming from a Greek director, I tried to take *Dogtooth*'s philosophical strength seriously. The film became a negative icon—not showing the sacred directly but revealing it through its violent absence. My frustration, my boredom, my somatic revolt—these weren't failures to "get" the film but the intelligence of my being asserting itself against ontological death.

Dark intelligibility operates in this space—not climbing toward light but being illuminated by darkness, not solving mystery but being solved by it. We don't transcend aporia; we learn to read by its shadow-light, finding in our very failure to capture meaning the presence of what exceeds capture.

The paradox of aporia requires us to treat it as what Desmond calls hyperintelligibility—or in our frame, dark intelligibility. We make present the negativity: the discomfort, shadow, frustrated meaning, limits of language. We highlight the insufficiency of pure daylight reason and reveal the urgency for night's mystery to meet its conjunction with day.

This isn't the via negativa of neti neti ("not this, not that") but something more visceral—making the blockage itself luminous. The semantic constipation becomes the pressure that forces breakthrough. The impasse becomes the site where new passages might open, but only if we have what Desmond calls "idiotic trust"—the "overdeterminate faith" that "is other to determinate and self-determining reason" yet "is not absurd; it is the mustard seed of agapeic minding in us" (*God and the Between*, 340).

## Being as Threat and Gift: The Neurobiology of Ultimate Concern

Our existential choices relating to our survival can trigger us in the same way that our ultimate concerns do. The state of our being is an existential threat as well as a gift. Our survival and our ultimate concerns press on the same nerve.

It seems logical our drive for survival becomes exacted in our drive for self-determination. Our **hypertrophied conatus** seems to be rooted in the same mechanisms that stimulate our survival, namely stress and other bodily feedback. It can be compared to a trauma victim whose nervous system cannot turn off and is always in a state of threat. Since the overall structure of the brain has developed sequentially through time, we become victims of the same primal structures in place for millions of years.

The **conatus essendi**—our striving to persist in being—lies at the heart of the problem. The limits of self-determination are acutely felt by a being whose potentialities are isolated in a devalued ethos no longer able to make connections because all the relations are already ossified. When we are already dying through systemic oppression, spiritual bypassing, and cultural metabolic failure, the fear of dissolution through genuine encounter becomes a false protection.

## Metabolic Capacity and the Ordeal

The degree to which we affirm or negate, or affirm our negations of being seems to determine our **metabolic capacity** for our ordeals. This capacity refers to our ability to digest as it is, coming to grips with being as it is given—what Clarice Lispector calls the "saltless" truth.

When we're able to metabolize the "saltless" truth, we open up to the indeterminate—learning to find nourishment in what initially appears toxic or indigestible.

This capacity is not merely intellectual but fundamentally somatic. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this viscerally: she must literally incorporate what repulses her human digestive system, vomiting first the civilized "milk and bread" of breakfast, then later spitting out the roach's matter while recognizing it as "taste of myself."

The **ordeal** is created when we realize the cracks in our mediating self—those inevitable fissures where the hyperintelligible breaks through our carefully maintained filters. We are not cut off completely; cracks in our mediating self can expose us to our thing-part. Therefore it beckons us to step into truth, to recognize the full spectrum of being and shed our human chrysalis.

Upon breaking open the hyperintelligible shines through with a vibratory intensity—overwhelming, too much, striking us to our core precisely because it _is_ our core that we have actively tried to manage, filter, contain. But it cannot be contained when the cracks are already revealed. Yet we must break our chrysalis ourselves to demonstrate our metabolic capacity.

To live with dark intelligibility means learning to metabolize these blockages sustainably, without either closing off in refusal or being consumed by the excess. It means maintaining what Lispector demonstrates—sustained vulnerability, the courage to remain disorganized, to keep our porosity open even to what terrifies us. It means being willing to sit with films that bore us, that suffocate us, until we understand that our very suffocation is teaching us something essential about our need for breath, for passage, for the possibility of relation.

## The Purge: Somatic Knowing and Visceral Integration

**Repression is the banishment of forms of knowing to the body**—what cannot be thought becomes lodged in flesh, held in tension, calcified into blockage. The body becomes the repository for what consciousness refuses to metabolize. But the body is not a tomb. It is a living archive that seeks to communicate what has been silenced.

The purge is what happens when we become porous anew—when the sealed channels of circulation reopen and blocked energy can finally surface and speak. This is not primarily about expulsion but about **communication**: the body is trying to tell us something, to make present what has been banished. The nausea, the shaking, the tears, the trembling—these are not symptoms to be managed but **utterances to be received**.

A circulation of energy becomes expressed. It surfaces bodily and mentally at once, indivisibly. We cry and the crying _is_ the grief made manifest, not its symptom. We shake and the shaking _is_ the fear finding voice, not its side effect. An experience is triggered, rises to consciousness, demands acknowledgment. The somatic and psychic are revealed as always already unified—what we call "mental" and "physical" are arbitrary divisions of a single communicative event.

This is a moment of intimate dialogue with our own being. If that communication can be received—if we can listen to what the body is saying rather than pathologizing its speech—then integration becomes possible. The purging is enacted through our participatory affirmation, our willingness to be present to what arises, to do the work of metabolization rather than flee back into repression.

The purge is often elemental, somatic: the yawn that releases held breath, the tears that speak unspeakable sorrow, the discharge that completes interrupted circuits. What is commonly deemed abject—that which must be expelled, separated from us—reveals itself as energy seeking completion, circulation seeking restoration. After it passes through us, the subtle body no longer carries that particular weight. Not because we have thrown something away, but because we have finally allowed it to complete its movement, to say what it needed to say.

The counterfeit double of Cartesian subjectivity dissolves here. Our entire "reconfigured ethos" is built on the lie that mind is separate from body, that thought stands apart from flesh. The mental abject (trauma, grief, shadow) is seen as something to be managed by rational thought, while the physical abject is dismissed as mere "biological process" to be hidden and sanitized. The pharmakon par excellence reveals this separation as the illusion it is.

The body and mind are forced back into their primordial, unified state: a single, living, feeling organism engaged in continuous communication with itself. Weeping is not a symptom of sadness but sadness made visible, audible, tangible. The purge becomes the enactment of releasing what has been held—not throwing away, but completing the circuit, allowing the energy to move through and transform.

Our shaking is the direct, unmediated response to confronting our own being without the usual filters. When we allow this—when we participate in rather than resist the purge—our porosity is restored. The channels that had clotted reopen. Communication is reestablished between the differentiated but unified dimensions of our being.

When mind and body meet in this concrescence, we become porous to ourselves anew. We find ourselves alive in the hyperbole. Swept into it. On fire. Ecstatic. Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming, Sighing. The grammar of the metaxu is revealed in its full intensity, a language of pure verbs, of pure happening. The sovereign "I" dissolves. There is no longer an "I" who is weeping or an "I" who is laughing. There is simply Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming.

This is a state of full participation. We are no longer experiencing; there is happening. We are no longer seeing the flame; there is burning. The purge has restored us to the immediacy of being, where communication flows unobstructed between all dimensions of our existence.

## Meeting Desire: The Paradox of Self-Reception

The paradox of the pharmakon extends to our relationship with desire itself. When we long for the cessation of desire, we find ourselves caught in an obvious paradox: longing for the end of longing is itself another desire. When we set intentions (to be open, to be free) they are also tangled up in this longing—and in some way, that grasping keeps us from actually inhabiting those states.

The practice becomes: listen to the desire—not fix it or analyze it, just be with it. Turn toward it, invite it to show itself. There is no internal dialogue at first, just a felt sense. Stay with that sensation. What are you longing for? This is dialoguing with desire about our desires.

But then something shifts. We are no longer just exploring the content of the desire—we are encountering the desire itself. Something is acknowledged. We embrace this part of ourselves—mentally, emotionally—and feel embraced by ourselves.

The realization: **The knot is the heart. My desire is my heart. And my heart, which had been longing to be met, is finally met—by myself.**

The paradox is tender, and a little absurd. We had been longing to receive something we could only give to ourselves. This is the pharmakon working: the poison of unmet longing becomes the medicine of self-recognition. The ordeal of desire becomes the gift of wholeness.

## Meditation, Ambiguity, and Metabolic Failure

The problem with framing meditation as a 'relaxation technique' or a 'health promoting technique' immediately strips it of its ontological and existential stakes. Meditation becomes a **product**—a stress reliever, a performance booster, a wellness brand.

When framed this way, any deviation from marketed benefits is pathologized as *user error* or *pre-existing condition*. This represents **capitalism over ambiguity**—a "brand defense" orientation that refuses to acknowledge the **pharmakon** nature of spiritual practice.

**The fundamental ambiguity of being is the medicine that is taken.** Meditation should not be a refuge from existential dread—it should inquire into the root of those things. Yet it is precisely in **equivocal waters where the biggest shifts in our perception occur, for good or for bad**.

If we are not aligned to being, then meditation practice might further exacerbate our condition. The **harm being the benefit** is not a bug but a feature—though this requires mature guidance within established traditions rather than commodified practices.

True contemplative traditions aim at **wholeness**, not wellness. This includes sickness, suffering, confusion, even madness. The **shadow is not something to be eliminated, but integrated**.

The **biggest perceptual shifts happen in equivocal waters**. The liminal space, the in-between, where identity loses its grip and the world opens up. This is dangerous terrain, yes. But also sacred. Initiatory. Fertile.

Modern society has **neither the myths, metaphors, nor institutions** to hold people who undergo destabilization. Without robust tradition (sangha, spiritual guide), people are left flailing. In a world frame that is already sick, it is not surprising that people would fall more sick in meditation or any other practice. The harm is often not in the practice but in **the way our culture lacks the ability to honor or metabolize transformation**.

## You Must Change Your Life

Ordeal comes as heteronomy, as Rilke's command *"You must change your life."* But it also demands our willingness to undergo. It is a participatory surrender, a choice that is also not a choice.

The pharmakon of being cannot be avoided; it can only be received, consciously or unconsciously. The question is whether we can metabolize reality, or whether we are metabolized by our refusal.

This returns us to the question posed in the first chapter; following Desmond's sense of the open whole, do we arrive at a liberated autonomy? An autonomy that knows itself to be plurivocal and connected to others? The pharmakon deepens the given that autonomy and heteronomy are not opposed but interpenetrating. The other speaks through us, even in the form of a transcendent other, through which our primal ethos is expressed.

The pharmakon of being is about positioning us to come within the intimacy of being, closer to a passio that allows itself to be vulnerable to terror, the other in ourselves that we have ostracized. We become ourselves more fully by allowing the plurivocal relationships explored in Chapter 1.

## Toward Ontological Nutrition

This framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be sophisticated technologies for **metabolic development**—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range—learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on pure being without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

The Pharmakon of Being ultimately names both the challenge and the promise of existence: the same reality that can dissolve unprepared consciousness becomes, for those with sufficient metabolic capacity, the deepest form of nourishment available to human awareness.

We desperately need **ritual containers**, **philosophical depth**, and **existential courage** to meet the ambiguity that the pharmakon reveals. A truthful spiritual practice should include the whole spectrum, good and bad. The **fundamental ambiguity of any practice** is not something to be eliminated but engaged with **finesse rather than geometry**.

The pharmakon of being cannot be resolved through scientific taxonomy but must be lived, metabolized, and integrated through **mature spiritual practice** within **wisdom traditions** that understand transformation's necessarily **equivocal waters**.

The question isn't how to avoid aporia but how to bear it, how to let it work on us until the blockage itself becomes the clearing. Like the river spirit in *Spirited Away*, we must trust that beneath the accumulated grime of our constructions flows something pure—not because it was never contaminated, but because it can be restored to flow through the patient work of metabolization. We find, in the very heart of impasse, the poros that was always there—making way by withdrawing, opening passage through its own recession.

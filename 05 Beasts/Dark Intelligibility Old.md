“Become all flame,” said Abba Joseph

Dark intelligibility is an idea that came to me in an encounter with Clarice Lispector. I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, designated with terms like '[[Dark femininity]]' or '[[Witchcraft]]'. Her friend [[Otto Lara Resende]] famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, dangerous, alien. Therefore I would like to investigate the feminine aspects of her work, as well as on the flip side, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'. 

I feel an unease with the cultural framing of Lispector as "witch" or "mystic". Even in framing "witch" as an empowering, subversive, counter-dogmatic -- can still reinforce the patriarchal logic of marginalization. Framed as an outsider this could still perpetuate rather than challenge the structures that created exclusion. Beyond that, why subscribe to any binary?

What's at stake in Lispector isn't the romanticization of marginality but something more fundamental: the recognition that authentic encounter with being necessarily exceeds categorical frameworks.  Even canonical female mystics like Hildegard, Teresa, or Julian retain their rupturing power not through institutional legitimacy but through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated.

The contemplations of Augustine's _intimior intimo meo_, for example, retain their rupturing power precisely through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated. When we encounter Teresa's _Interior Castle_ or Eckhart's sermons, what moves us isn't their institutional legitimacy but the immediate presence of someone who has **been there** - the trembling authenticity that no amount of theological framework can fully contain or explain.

This is what we are approaching with dark intelligibility. What is framed as feminine is porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening to her, represents a methodological approach. To be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, idolization of autonomy.[^1]  

The fundamental ambiguity of being is what I liken to the idea of the Pharmakon. At once medicine and poison, . The degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our 'metabolic capacity' for our ordeals. 

>"This is madness, I thought with my eyes closed. But it was so undeniable a feeling that birth from inside the dust -- that all I could do was follow something I was well aware wasn't madness, it was, my God, the worse truth, the horrible one. But why horrible? Because with out words it contradicted everything I used to think also without words." [[Clarice Lispector]] , Passion According to G.H..

I felt deep intimacy with these 'without words'. In encountering our overdetermined ground our stabilized frames of the world are challenged. Confronted with an immense vertigo there is a frightening realization. It is frightening precisely because it challenges our stability.  I am captivated with her [[apophasis]], aporia, and her courage to face Being fully, even if it means emptying herself. Even if it would make her old self a '[[counterfeit double]]'.

>"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced -- in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one" 

Here she aptly intimates the violence of the indeterminate. The encounter makes our old way of being insufficient. Yet whether we are able to bear a new way is another question. By that point we have little say in the matter. Rilke's "You must change your life" comes to us as a command. You became porous, so adapt.

>"as though I had lose a third leg that ... kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod. ... And I've gone back to being someone I never was." "Am I disorganized because I have lost something I didn't even need?"  [[Clarice Lispector]]

This disorganization reveals something crucial about our modern condition. The hyperactivity of our conatus—our drive to be, to assert, to control—stems from a deeper impatience and fear. Impatience with the indeterminate, with the inherent ambiguity of the between, the lack of immediate answer or complete control. And fear—fear of too much that exceeds us, fear of facing the nakedness of being without the armor of self-assertion. What Lispector calls her "third leg" is precisely this conatus overdrive: a reactive attempt to impose order and meaning onto a reality perceived as lacking, valueless, threatening. 

The fundamental ambiguity of being is what I like to approach through the concept of the Pharmakon of Being. Lispector pinpoints this ambiguity precisely: 

>"How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation ... to being". 

She confronts the fear deeply without trying to solve it. For the unknown as well as mysterious and sublime is terrifying. The violence of grace disorients the notion of self. It places us in the strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged. This is precisely the metaxu that Desmond talks about.

In Lispector's work there is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Perhaps this is what I'm trying to articulate with Dark Intelligibility. As a work on limits we identify the limits, however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper - hypo ). Directly I should make the case that we are considering something different than desmond's hyperintelligible. I'm not sure that is the case right now. 

I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like transtheism. [[Eckhart]]'s words "I pray to God to rid me of God". And [[Nishitani]]'s Sunyata: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness. 

I see myself oscillating between [[William Desmond|Desmond]] and Nishitani. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. But this oscillation itself passes through an ordeal—the nihilizing process isn't inherently revelatory. It's primarily destructive, an ordeal that must be endured rather than something that directly illuminates. During this dark passage, the only hints of what lies beyond come through counterfeit doubles—seductive mimicries that masquerade as the genuine article—or moments of genuine aesthetic recharge that break through the nihilistic fog, like Lispector's own "without words." In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is [[kenosis]] here, and [[metanoia]]. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal.

This letting-be requires what might be called a leap of faith—returning to passio and becoming porous involves leaving the apparent comfort and perceived agency of a conatus-driven self, yielding to a more receptive mode. It means trusting the givenness of being even when that givenness is experienced as too much, too ambiguous, and challenges our flimsy house of cards of meaning-making with a nihilizing kenosis that blows it apart. Beyond the distorted view of an ego-driven conatus, being shows its true nature as gift, as communication, as the porosity Lispector so courageously embodied.

Abba Isaac once said:

> “To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you.”

When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling. The falling of the faces.

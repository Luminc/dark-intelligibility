# Dark Intelligibility

"Become all flame," said Abba Joseph

## I. Cultural Framing and the Problem of "Dark Femininity"

Dark intelligibility is an idea that came to me in the discussion on Lispector. I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, encountering terms like '[[Dark femininity]]' or '[[Witchcraft]]'. Her friend [[Otto Lara Resende]] famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, alien. Therefore I would like to investigate the feminine aspects of her work, as well as on the flip side, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'.[^1]

On one hand there is a cultural critique to be made by framing lispector's femininity even though her mystical register is beyond categorization. What is framed as feminine is porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening to her, which is her courage. It becomes witchcraft perhaps through the fact that it is esoteric. In that, in the frame of the religious, it is erupting as a private, secret exercise. As a reader, to be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, our 'reconfigured ethos'.[^2]

[[Derrida]] through [[Cixous]]: a writing of the 'limit' --- [[aporia]], unsaying, [[feminine messianicity]][^3]

## II. The Violence of Disorganization

>"This is madness, I thought with my eyes closed. But it was so undeniable a feeling that birth from inside the dust -- that all I could do was follow something I was well aware wasn't madness, it was, my God, the worse truth, the horrible one. But why horrible? Because with out words it contradicted everything I used to think also without words." [[Clarice Lispector]], Passion According to G.H.

I felt deep intimacy with these 'without words'. In encountering our overdetermined ground our stabilized frames of the world are challenged. Confronted with an immense vertigo there is a frightening realization. It is frightening precisely because it challenges our stability. I am captivated with her [[apophasis]], aporia, and her courage to face Being fully, even if it means emptying herself. Even if it would make her old self a '[[counterfeit double]]'.

>"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced -- in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one"

here she aptly intimates the violence of the indeterminate.[^4]

>"as though I had lose a third leg that ... kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod. ... And I've gone back to being someone I never was." "Am I disorganized because I have lost something I didn't even need?" [[Clarice Lispector]]

She portrays the arrival at [[the zero point]] and the return back to our [[Reconfigured ethos]], intimately affected, violently even, by [[the primal ethos]]. She pinpoints the tension to the [[Pharmakon]] deeply "How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation ... to being". I have never seen such [[porosity]] and beauty. She confronts the fear deeply and that is the violence (or grace) of the indeterminate which disorients the notion of self. Which puts it in a strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged. What can be related to the notion of the Khora. A generative ground in the transjective space of the singular and universal.[^5]

## III. Transtheism: Between Apophasis and Phasis

There is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like transtheism.[^6] [[Eckhart]]'s words "I pray to God to rid me of God". And [[Nishitani]]'s Sunyata: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness.

I see myself oscillating between [[William Desmond|Desmond]] and Nishitani. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is [[kenosis]] here, and [[metanoia]]. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal.[^7]

## IV. The Dropping of Faces: Dreams and Hyperbolic Experience

Abba Isaac once said:

> "To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you."

When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling. The falling of the faces.[^8]

In one of my dreams I made such an image. It was a face, or the emptiness of a face, enshrined in a veil, like an empty form wearing a ritualistic headdress. Ornate and sacred, I felt like it had hidden something too terrifying for me to be unveiled. My mind had given me an enshrined face to hold what was too intense, too difficult to conceive. The mind was protecting me from overwhelm. The DMT experience was overwhelming in that excessive exposure to absolute [[Hyperbolic dimension|hyperbole]]. As much as it healed me it haunted me, because it threatened to overwhelm me. The dropping of the face is again becoming ready to receive from what's shining in the fissures.[^9]

## Footnotes

[^1]: **Underdeveloped**: The gendered framing of mysticism needs deeper analysis. How does the cultural construction of "dark femininity" relate to broader patterns of marginalizing women's spiritual experiences? What is the relationship between the esoteric and the feminine in Western thought?

[^2]: **Question for exploration**: What exactly constitutes a "reconfigured ethos"? How does this differ from simple disorientation or trauma? Is there a threshold between transformation and destruction?

[^3]: **Needs expansion**: The connection between Derrida-Cixous and Lispector's apophatic writing requires development. What specifically is "feminine messianicity" and how does it operate in Lispector's texts?

[^4]: **Critical concept**: "The violence of the indeterminate" appears central but underdeveloped. Is this violence necessary for transformation? How does it relate to Levinas's notion of ethical violence or Derrida's violence of language?

[^5]: **Major underdevelopment**: The Khora concept is mentioned but not explored. This seems crucial - how does Plato's notion of the receptacle (khora) illuminate the "transjective space"? What is the relationship between khora, the maternal, and the mystical?

[^6]: **Needs theoretical grounding**: "Transtheism" is proposed as a new term but requires definition and differentiation from existing concepts like panentheism, process theology, or negative theology. What makes this position unique?

[^7]: **Question for development**: How exactly does this oscillation between Desmond and Nishitani work? What are the tensions between Desmond's metaxological approach and Nishitani's Buddhist emptiness? Can they be genuinely synthesized?

[^8]: **Phenomenological gap**: "The falling of the faces" is poetic but needs philosophical grounding. How does this relate to Levinas's face-to-face encounter? Or to the iconoclastic tradition?

[^9]: **Needs integration**: The DMT experience and dream material are rich but disconnected from the theoretical framework. How do these altered states relate to the philosophical concepts of apophasis, khora, and transtheism? What epistemological status do such experiences have?

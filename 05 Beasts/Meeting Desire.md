I was chatting with ChatGPT about [[attention]] and [[intention]], how they shape cognition, but also how deeply they affect the body, our emotions, and how we perceive the world. I started noticing how unconscious intentions ( like wanting to be seen, or simply wanting to be present ) can create subtle tension in the body, especially when those desires remain unmet or unacknowledged.

Then I started thinking about the cessation of [[desire]]. I realized I was longing for that, and of course, saw the obvious paradox: longing for the end of longing is itself another desire. When I set intentions (to be open, to be free) they are also tangled up in this longing — and in some way, that grasping was keeping me from actually inhabiting those states.

So I did a small exercise. I decided to listen to the desire — not fix it or analyze it, just be with it. I turned toward it, invited it to show itself. There was no internal dialogue at first, just a felt sense: a soft knot in my belly.

I stayed with that sensation, and then questions began to arise. What are you longing for? Contact? Expression? To be in the world as an artist? To choose your own way of relating? I was dialoguing with desire about my desires.

But then something shifted. I wasn’t just exploring the content of the desire anymore — I was encountering the desire itself. I gave it my full attention. And suddenly, I was crying. Something had been acknowledged. I hugged this part of me — mentally, emotionally — and I felt embraced by myself.

After a moment of integration, I checked in again. The knot in my belly was gone, but now I could feel my heartbeat very clearly. The sensation was vivid — my blood moving, energy pulsing — and it hit me: the knot is the heart. My desire is my heart. And my heart, which had been longing to be met, was finally met — by me.

That realization made me laugh and cry at the same time. The paradox was so tender, and a little absurd. I had been longing to receive something I could only give to myself.

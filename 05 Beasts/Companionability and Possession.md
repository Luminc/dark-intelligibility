# On Companionability and Possession: A Breath of Life

*"I really like things I don't understand. When I read a thing I don't understand, I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo."*  
—Clarice Lispector, *A Breath of Life*, p. 29

I should disorganize, and yet structure simultaneously. I should create meta-structures that can kiss disorganization here and there. I love the pen. I'm too disconnected from the physical process of writing. There is a different flow when you actually draw the words. What has language done for me? The question is rather: **How does the determined become companionable to indeterminacy?** How light and dark conjoin in chiaroscuro? 

In a world where ambiguity dominates and social cohesion evaporates, and too much meaning exists—univocal, equivocal, or otherwise—there is still the stage of self-determination which demands attention, the spectacle. Being is communicative, but it is inseparable from non-being. I seem to be spinning around dualities again. There remains the urgency for fidelity to their conjunctions and interpenetrations. However, the demands and libidinal economies of life hijack our capacity to open to them.

And I know that this seems familiar. Let us stop making sense for a moment and try to delve deeper.

Words do not come easy at times, so we let them be. It is natural not to know the way, so we should become lost. If there is one thing clear I can say about myself, it is that I'm lost. I find things, things happen to me, but I am groundless, like a cell breaking open, its contents spilling out. This disorganization can be messy. How can I write without knowing where to go? I shall have somebody else write through me. Starting with my parental voices, Clarice Lispector and William Desmond.

## The Rule of the Other

Heteronomy is the intrusion autonomy tries to prevent. Just think of nationalists in immigration panic. The other intrudes, if not capable of being dominated, at least made manageable. 

The other intrudes in myself as well. In my voice, my very being, there is a whole host of voices speaking through me. It is certainly astonishing that we, such porous interconnected beings, think of ourselves as autonomous. At any given moment I am possessed by voices not my own.

*Cum panis* indeed. Following Desmond's sense of the open whole, do we arrive at a liberated autonomy? An autonomy that knows itself to at least be plurivocal and connected to others?

## Drawing Words

To return briefly to the chiaroscuro: a beautiful word, for I used to draw too, and writing is an extension of drawing. The mediaticity of writing physically is its own medium. I have drawn on tablets and made beautiful life drawings but they remain digital files. 

If we consider writing the techno-pharmakon par excellence then of course we cannot underestimate the power of a trembling hand furtively scribbling thoughts to the page as if the line was its very consciousness.

Sweet and abysmal because, hell, we have no idea and we still want to sit with the question. Companionable to the question.

Breath, dissolution, structure, should be part of writing. Words should be able to breathe. We can run into blockages and aporia and what do we do? Give up? Hunt further? 

Or let it breathe? 

Aporia is companionable to the going, sweetly abysmal as it is.

## On Possession and Freedom

My desire for possession comes not from a desire for self-dissolution but for recognizing interdependence and flowing in the river. What freedom would that give? It could be radical.

The body writes and has written for a few thousand years, enough for it to be a new page in our evolutionary techgnosis. Quickly it is being abandoned for the keyboard and the screen. Command line interfaces. 

While there are ways of exaptation and we are of course fluid beings in becoming, I do still like physical writing. Perhaps precisely because it is a form of drawing.

## The Triangle

Today it felt urgent to work but it also felt urgent to disorganize. 

I was playful in letting Lispector and Desmond together with me make us into a triangle. Geometric stability through threeness, yet each point remains irreducible. Not synthesis but constellation.

Both Desmond and Clarice are enactive of what they write about. It is a lived philosophy after all. Porosity requires that intimacy, that vulnerability of expression in the midst of things. I want to get to the threshold of both thinkers.

The body writes. There is a restlessness there. This disorganization felt urgent, and it worked. But the danger is tying disorganization and productivity to any external means, lest we become too dependent. We are not independent—we allow heteronomy to affect our writing as well.

However, this disorganization and productivity is dangerous to be tied to any single source. Since I am not independent, I flow with the interdependence. But I must remain vigilant.

*The text ends here, mid-thought, as it should. Some writings don't conclude—they pause, they breathe, they wait.*

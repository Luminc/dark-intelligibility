“Not dark, just without light”  --Clarice Lispector



# Dark Intelligibility


Dark intelligibility is an idea that came to me in an encounter with Clarice Lispector. I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, designated with terms like '[[Dark femininity]]' or '[[Witchcraft]]'. Her friend [[Otto Lara Resende]] famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, dangerous, alien. Therefore I would like to investigate the feminine aspects of her work, as well as on the flip side, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'. 

I feel an unease with the cultural framing of Lispector as "witch" or "mystic". Even in framing "witch" as an empowering, subversive, counter-dogmatic -- can still reinforce the patriarchal logic of marginalization. Framed as an outsider this could still perpetuate rather than challenge the structures that created exclusion. Beyond that, why subscribe to any binary?

What's at stake in Lispector isn't the romanticization of marginality but something more fundamental: the recognition that authentic encounter with being necessarily exceeds categorical frameworks.  Even canonical female mystics like Hildegard, Teresa, or Julian retain their rupturing power not through institutional legitimacy but through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated.

The contemplations of Augustine's _intimior intimo meo_, for example, retain their rupturing power precisely through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated. When we encounter Teresa's _Interior Castle_ or Eckhart's sermons, what moves us isn't their institutional legitimacy but the immediate presence of someone who has been there - the trembling authenticity that no amount of theological framework can fully contain or explain.

This is what we are approaching with dark intelligibility. What is framed as feminine is porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening to her, represents a methodological approach. To be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, our idolization of autonomy.[^1]  

## The metaxu as overdetermined between

Desmond's concept of [[metaxu]]—the "between"—provides the framework for understanding how both thinkers navigate the space where intelligible and unintelligible meet. The metaxu is the rich ontological medium where different modes of being encounter each other. As Desmond explains in *Being and the Between*, "Nothing is defined through itself alone. Beings are defined in a rich ontological intermedium of happening, and are both other-relating and self-relating."[^2]

This "between" operates through what Desmond calls **"[[double mediation]]"**—both self-mediation (consciousness thinking itself through its other) and intermediation (the other's genuine mediation from its own otherness). Unlike dialectical thinking, which ultimately reduces otherness to self-relation, metaxological thinking maintains genuine plurality within unity. ( j: this is an essential point )

Lispector's literary practice embodies this same space of double mediation. In *The Passion According to G.H.*, the protagonist's encounter with the cockroach creates precisely such a metaxu—a space where human and non-human, subject and object, familiar and strange meet without reduction to dialectical unity. **The cockroach's "thick radiant indifference" becomes a gateway to what G.H. calls "inhuman life"**—not the opposite of human life, but life experienced from beyond the boundaries of human categorization.(j: this is still excellent and well articulated, flows well from desmond to Lispector)

Both thinkers understand this "between" as overdetermined rather than indeterminate. For Desmond, being presents itself as "surplus givenness"—an excessive abundance that gives rise to astonishment.(j: this can be linked to a citation about Desmond's astonishment) For Lispector, reality exceeds linguistic capture not through poverty but through richness: "reality is too delicate, only reality is delicate, my unreality and my imagination are heavier."(j: beautiful quote, needs page numbers)
# The Pharmakon of Being: Ordeal and the Violence of Grace

There is a fundamental ambiguity to being we can approach through the notion of the  [[Pharmakon]]. The degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our 'metabolic capacity' for being.

>"This is madness, I thought with my eyes closed. But it was so undeniable a feeling that birth from inside the dust -- that all I could do was follow something I was well aware wasn't madness, it was, my God, the worse truth, the horrible one. But why horrible? Because without words it contradicted everything I used to think also without words." [[Clarice Lispector]] , Passion According to G.H..

I felt deep intimacy with these 'without words'. An intimation of knowing that is prior to our language, closer to the ground of truth in our being. In encountering that overdetermined ground our stabilized frame of the world becomes creaky. As that frame is threatened to be blown away we are confronted with an immense vertigo and there is a frightening realization. But what precisely is realized is as alien to us as it is home. I am captivated with her [[apophasis]], aporia, and her courage to face Being fully, even if it means eroding herself. Even if it would make her old self a '[[counterfeit double 1]]'.

>"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced -- in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one" 

We build so much weight onto identity that when it collapses we are unmoored. She aptly intimates the violence of that encounter with indeterminacy. The encounter makes our old way of being insufficient. Yet whether we are able to bear a new way is another question. By that point we have little say in the matter. Rilke's "You must change your life" comes to us as a command. You became porous, so adapt. Suffer grace.

>"as though I had lose a third leg that ... kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod. ... And I've gone back to being someone I never was." "Am I disorganized because I have lost something I didn't even need?"

This disorganization reveals something crucial about our modern condition. The hyperactivity of our conatus—our drive to be, that hungry quest for self-determination and a sense of control -- and ultimately the failure of self transcendence kindles a deeper impatience and fear. Impatience with the indeterminate, with the inherent ambiguity of the between, the lack of immediate answer. And fear—fear of too much that exceeds us, fear of facing the nakedness of being without the armor of self-assertion. The character in Lispector's book loses her "third leg", that false anchor. But losing it means the threat of being directly expose to a reality perceived as lacking, valueless, threatening. 

The fundamental ambiguity of being is what I like to approach through the concept of the Pharmakon of Being. Lispector pinpoints this ambiguity precisely: 

>"How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation ... to being". 

She confronts the fear deeply without trying to solve it. For the unknown as well as mysterious and sublime is terrifying. The violence of grace disorients the notion of self. It places us in the strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged. This is precisely the metaxu that Desmond talks about.

# The Thing-part and Neutral Being

In The Passion According to G.H., Lispector acknowledges something that is already there before all our conceptions of being human: “the inhuman part is the best part of us… the thing-part of us… matter of God, waiting to reclaim me.” The inhuman here is not the alienated other, nor the negation of the human. It is nearer to us than our own self-conceptions, nearer than the “self” that thinks it stands apart from the world.

“Why shouldn’t I become unclean, exactly as I was discovering my whole self to be?” This question collapses the hierarchy between human and thing, revealing the co-identity of self and non-self, the neutral being in which we participate alongside the roach, the stone, the dust. The “thing-part” is not a degradation but a reclaiming: the intimacy of the impersonal, the suchness of matter-of-God, the elemental flesh that precedes our personhood.

Lispector’s discovery is not without terror: “it was a joy without redemption… a joy without hope.” This is joy untethered from any counterfeit double of salvation — no promise of return, no narrative arc to make sense of it. It does not lead elsewhere. And precisely because it is without hope, it is pure: a joy that redeems only by annihilating the need for redemption.

Here the violence of grace becomes visible. The suchness of being overflows our capacity to receive it without trembling. The gift terrifies and attracts because it annihilates the prison in which the self guards its boundaries. It does not flatter our stability; it strips it away.

This is the ground where Dark Intelligibility emerges: the place where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. It is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess — where understanding and un-understanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

In this register, to encounter being is to be claimed by it, drawn into the impersonal intimacy of suchness, where self and non-self mingle, and the only fidelity is to remain porous — even to what terrifies us.

In Lispector's work there is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Perhaps this is what I'm trying to articulate with Dark Intelligibility. As a work on limits we identify the limits, however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper - hypo ). Directly I should make the case that we are considering something different than desmond's hyperintelligible. I'm not sure that is the case right now. 

# Towards a non-binary theism

I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like transtheism. [[Eckhart]]'s words "I pray to God to rid me of God". And [[Nishitani]]'s Sunyata: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness. 

I see myself oscillating between [[William Desmond|Desmond]] and Nishitani. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. But this oscillation itself passes through an ordeal—the nihilizing process isn't inherently revelatory. It's primarily destructive, an ordeal that must be endured rather than something that directly illuminates. During this dark passage, the only hints of what lies beyond come through counterfeit doubles—seductive mimicries that masquerade as the genuine article—or moments of genuine aesthetic recharge that break through the nihilistic fog, like Lispector's own "without words." In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is [[kenosis]] here, and [[metanoia]]. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal.

This letting-be requires what might be called a leap of faith—returning to passio and becoming porous involves leaving the apparent comfort and perceived agency of a conatus-driven self, yielding to a more receptive mode. It means trusting the givenness of being even when that givenness is experienced as too much, too ambiguous, and challenges our flimsy house of cards of meaning-making with a nihilizing kenosis that blows it apart. Beyond the distorted view of an ego-driven conatus, being shows its true nature as gift, as communication, as the porosity Lispector so courageously embodied.

Abba Isaac once said:

> “To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you.”

When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling. The falling of the faces.

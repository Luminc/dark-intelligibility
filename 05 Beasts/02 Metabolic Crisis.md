# Metabolic Crisis

>"All the world began with a yes. One molecule said yes to another molecule and life was born."[L3]

Chapter 1 established our condition: we exist in the *metaxu*, and being itself arrives as a *pharmakon*—an overwhelming gift that is both poison and cure. Now we turn from the philosophical structure of this problem to its lived, visceral reality. This chapter explores the crisis precipitated by the Pharmakon of Being: the foreclosure of the gift, the necessary violence of grace, and the climactic purge that leads to transformation.

## The Gift and Its Foreclosure

Being gives itself as pure excess, agapeic letting-be. The gift arrives without condition, without demand for return—what Desmond calls the ontological "yes" we already *are* before we know it. "By virtue of the *passio essendi* we are already participants in a primal affirmation of the good of the 'to be'—ontologically we are the living of this affirmation before we know of it." Simply by continuing to be, we already affirm existence. This is the elemental yes: not something we achieve but what we already participate in by virtue of being at all.

Yet this gift places us in radical vulnerability. To be given is to be finite, to be dependent, to be exposed to what exceeds us. This ontological vulnerability is not debt but the very structure of creaturely existence—the *passio essendi*, our fundamental porosity to what is beyond us.

Debt arises not from the gift itself but from our response to this vulnerability. When we cannot metabolize our ontological porosity—when the *conatus essendi* refuses the inherent vulnerability of *passio essendi*—we foreclose the gift through a futile attempt to master what can only be received. This foreclosure is what we might call "sin" as existential posture: not the acceptance of a contaminated gift but the *metabolic failure* to receive the gift.

The gift arrives as pharmakon—not because it is inherently poisonous but because our inability to receive it can make it so. Desmond hints at this metabolic dimension: "We clot on ourselves again and close the porosity. The blood stream of life is made the carrier of death."[D331] The same encounter with being's overdeterminate richness can either open us to deeper community or close us off into "counterfeit doubles" of authentic transcendence.

## The Violence of Grace

There is violence in grace—not cruelty, but the necessary destruction of what cannot withstand truth. Grace strikes like a knife, collapsing the 'familiar middle'—the counterfeit refuge built by conatus—and forcing us back into astonishment.

Lispector describes losing "a third leg that kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod."[L4] What provides stability also prevents genuine movement. The tripod of ordinary consciousness—grounded in self-certainty, conceptual mastery, and narrative coherence—keeps us upright but immobile. The violence of grace kicks away this third leg, forcing us to learn a terrifying new way of being.

The violence of grace occurs, yes, when we are somehow receptive to it. But perhaps it emerges from our ontological consent, which we already are. Our existential consent might struggle to undergo the ordeal but the original affirmation that we are calls us to transformation. We grow by being able to bear more of the totality, which includes the collapsing of our counterfeit refuges. Grace is then our alignment with the 'worse' truth. We accept the totality of light and dark because that is the truth of what is. While nihilism remains in pure negation it misses the radical conversion from "the self is empty" to "emptiness is self" (Nishitani) a generative, fertile, neutral emptiness over which penia-sive-poros are struck, porosity and poverty of the kenotic self.

This violence of grace strips away our constructions, revealing that the sense of agency itself dissolves. It's not a sense of otherness we discover but a sense of union through clear communication that turns into pure happening in which we are fully part. We become the process rather than standing outside observing it.

## Double Exposure and the Solitary One

What appears in this stripping bare is what Nishitani calls "double exposure"—reality appearing simultaneously under contradictory aspects without resolution. "The real Form of all things, including man, comes to be a 'double exposure' of life and death. All living things can be seen under the Form of death without thereby being separated from their proper Form of life."[N76]

This is not seeing death *instead* of life, nor dialectical synthesis. It is seeing life *and* death simultaneously, each fully present, neither canceling the other. This paradoxical structure finds philosophical articulation in Nishitani Keiji's concept of *soku* (即)—rendered by translator Jan van Bragt as *sive*—expressing radical interpenetration where seeming opposites mutually constitute each other.^[Van Bragt's choice to translate *soku* as the Latin *sive* captures the paradoxical identity-in-difference at the heart of Kyoto School philosophy. Unlike "or" (which separates) or "and" (which merely conjoins), *sive* expresses simultaneity and mutual constitution—A-sive-B means A is B precisely in not being B. This translation proves useful for articulating metaxological structures where opposites oscillate without collapsing into synthesis or remaining in pure duality.[N-intro-xxx]] Lispector experiences this viscerally: "I was eating myself, I who am also living matter of the Sabbath"[L135]—simultaneously eating and being eaten, destroying and being destroyed, dying and being born. Life-sive-death in double exposure.

Nishitani speaks of "the solitary one laid bare amidst the myriad phenomena"—and when we are stripped to essence, everything becomes more real. "In bearing witness to this solitary one laid bare, each and every phenomenon is by far more itself than it is on its own home-ground."[N199] The roach in its alien vitality, the neutral in its fertility, being itself in its astonishing thereness.

## Poros-Sive-Penia: The Structure of the Ordeal

Within the ordeal, we discover not mere blockage but a deeper structure: the interpenetration of poverty and passage, lack and opening. Lispector affirms this: "do not be afraid of neediness: it is our greater destiny."[L179] Neediness is not accidental to our being—it is our very structure in the midst of things.

*Penia* is poverty, lack, need—but not mere absence. Lispector articulates its paradoxical power: "The great emptiness in me shall be my place for existing; my extreme poverty shall be a great volition."[L158-159] The lack is not passive but active, generative, volitional.

*Poros* is passage, way, resource—but not straightforward path. As Desmond notes, poros carries connotations of "a way across," yet it is "a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way."[D41] The way opens by withdrawing. The passage creates space through its own recession.

Both poros and penia involve emptiness. They are not opposites but complementary movements of the same groundlessness. The hyphen in poros-sive-penia is crucial—not "poros or penia" but the radical interpenetration where each is the condition for the other's manifestation. This is the structure of the ordeal itself—we are suspended between emptiness that hungers and emptiness that opens. The ordeal intensifies our constitutional restlessness. We cannot rest in pure *penia*, for that way lies the madness of *eros turannos*—a consuming lack that can never be filled. Nor can we rest in pure *poros*, for that becomes a passive dissolution, a loss of self into the flow. The restlessness itself, this suspension between the two, *is* the energy of transformation.

## Sleepwalker's Courage and the Worse Truth

Lispector demonstrates what she calls sleepwalker's courage—the ability to move beyond the compulsive need to organize and reflect: "I was courageous like a sleepwalker who simply goes. During the hours of perdition I had the courage not to compose or organize. And above all not to look ahead."[L8]

She writes: "Perhaps what happened to me was an understanding—and for me to be true, I have to keep on being unable to grasp it, keep on not understanding it."[L8] The sleepwalker doesn't strategize each step; she allows herself to be moved by what she cannot consciously control. This is vulnerability as epistemological method—knowing that acknowledges the limits of autonomous reason while remaining open to forms of understanding that exceed those limits.

This leads to what she calls "the worse truth"[L53]—horrible not because it's false but because it confronts us with *totality*. The worse truth is the recognition that being gives itself as both beautiful and horrific, gift and ordeal, life-sive-death, without dialectical resolution. "Why would I be afraid of eating the good and the evil? if they exist that is because that is what exists."[L151]

And yet—here is the paradox—this worse truth is also "the best truth" because it is *truth*. It opens the possibility of what she calls "hopeless joy": not joy despite the lack of hope, but joy that has moved beyond hope's comforting illusions. Radical affirmation won from absolute negation.

## Consent and Its Counterfeits

The ordeal brings us to a paradox: we must consent to what we cannot control, yield to what we would never choose. We are, as Desmond puts it, "the struggle between consent and refusal... consent as an overdeterminate trust in the basic goodness of being, or refusal as an indeterminate negation of, and dissent from, being as good at bottom."[D82] Rilke's "You must change your life"[R-archaic] names the demand our ontological porosity places on our existential self. We are already open, already porous, already given to be—and this givenness itself "must" us toward transformation. The resulting consent is not a simple submission, but what Desmond calls a gratitude "won from suffering; a 'yes' purged of complaint; an affirmation that has wept, as there is a mourning that is blessed."[D121]

The ordeal emerges because we have already consented to it—not through existential choice but through ontological structure. Lispector admits "I don't feel strong enough to stay disorganized"[L7]—this is existential incapacity. But she eats anyway, in dizziness, "not knowing," having "removed from myself all participation."[L174] The existential self steps aside so the ontological consent can work.

But the counterfeit voice arrives immediately. "It's hard to get lost," she admits. "It's so hard that I'll probably quickly figure out some way to find myself, even if finding myself is once again my vital lie."[L4] She recognizes the mechanism with striking clarity: "I know I'll need to be careful not to use furtively a new third leg that from me sprouts swiftly as weeds, and to call this protective leg 'a truth.'"[L6]

Desmond warns: "Any violence here, of course, is fraught with ambiguity, indeed danger. The stripping that claims to purify might secretly derive from the indeterminate negation rather than the elemental 'yes.' We are a mingling of opposites, and great discernment is needed to sift them. There is an asceticism of hatred; there is a purging of love; and hatred may speak the language of love."[D36]

## The Purge: Metabolic Climax

The moment arrives. Lispector recognizes what must happen: "Redemption had to be in the thing itself," which means "putting into my mouth the white paste of the roach."[L172-174] She calls it "the anti-sin," but one that comes "at the price of traversing a sensation of death." She rises "with the determination not of a suicide but of a murderer of myself."

The sweat begins—not ordinary perspiration but something primordial, "a sweat I didn't recognize and that smelled like what comes from dried-up earth after the first rains." She's swimming now in her "oldest primeval soup," the sweat as "plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae." She has become the process: "I was being, I was me being." This is metabolic wisdom unfolding—the body knows before the mind what transformation requires. Then the first purge is violent and entire: "I suddenly threw up the milk and bread I had eaten for breakfast... I had vomited the exaltation." The body expels what cannot be metabolized, including the very spiritual state that would have made the act bearable, forcing her to approach it "physically simple as a girl."

She eats, but not through will or consciousness. The act happens in dizziness, in a space where she has "removed from myself all participation," having "not wanted 'to know.'" Afterward, she reflects: "So that was how things were processed? 'Not knowing'—so that was how the deepest things happened?... Was the secret of never escaping from the greater life living like a sleepwalker?"[L173-174]

Then the second purge, the spitting. "I now felt the nastiness in my mouth, and then began to spit, to furiously spit that taste of no such thing." The Apocalypse verse surfaces: "because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth." But she discovers: "The neutral thing is extremely energetic, I was spitting and it was still I." She cannot expel the neutral because the neutral is what she is.

When we allow this—when we participate in rather than resist the purge—we restore porosity. The channels that had clotted reopen. We find ourselves alive in the hyperbole. Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming, Sighing. The grammar of the *metaxu* revealed in full intensity—a language of pure verbs, of pure happening. The sovereign "I" dissolves. There is no longer an "I" who weeps or laughs. There is simply Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming.

## Reality as Communication

What is real is what communicates to us. Lispector discovers this in the ordeal: pure communication becomes more real than any conceptual overlay. "All sudden understanding is finally the revelation of an acute incomprehension."[L8] The communication exceeds our capacity to grasp it conceptually, yet it transforms us nonetheless.

Lispector recognizes, finally: "The divine for me is whatever is real."[L175] Not the transcendent, not the beautiful, not even the meaningful—but the real itself, in its terrible and fertile neutrality. And then the admission: "I understood that, by placing in my mouth the paste of the roach, I was not stripping myself as the saints do, but was once again yearning for the accretion. The accretion is easier to love."[L178]

Even this radical gesture risks being counterfeit—seeking "more" when what's needed is acceptance of the neutral. But this recognition itself is metabolic wisdom: seeing the counterfeit even in the most extreme stripping.

The violence of grace strips away our constructions. What remains is not nothing but a transformed way of knowing. In the ruins of the familiar middle, in the metabolized ordeal, something new emerges: a knowing that has learned to dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

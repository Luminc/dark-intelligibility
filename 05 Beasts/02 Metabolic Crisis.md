# Metabolic Crisis

>"All the world began with a yes. One molecule said yes to another molecule and life was born." 
>—Clarice Lispector, *Hour of the Star*

Chapter 1 established our condition: we exist in the *metaxu*, and being itself arrives as a *pharmakon*—an overwhelming gift that is both poison and cure. Now we turn from the philosophical structure of this problem to its lived, visceral reality. This chapter explores the crisis precipitated by the Pharmakon of Being: the foreclosure of the gift, the necessary violence of grace, and the climactic purge that leads to transformation.

## The Gift and Its Foreclosure

Being gives itself as pure excess, agapeic letting-be. The gift arrives without condition, without demand for return—what Desmond calls the ontological "yes" we already *are* before we know it. "By virtue of the *passio essendi* we are already participants in a primal affirmation of the good of the 'to be'—ontologically we are the living of this affirmation before we know of it." Simply by continuing to be, we already affirm existence. This is the elemental yes: not something we achieve but what we already participate in by virtue of being at all.

Yet this gift places us in radical vulnerability. To be given is to be finite, to be dependent, to be exposed to what exceeds us. This ontological vulnerability is not debt but the very structure of creaturely existence—the *passio essendi*, our fundamental porosity to what is beyond us.

Debt arises not from the gift itself but from our response to this vulnerability. When we cannot metabolize our ontological porosity—when the *conatus essendi* refuses the inherent vulnerability of *passio essendi*—we foreclose the gift through a futile attempt to master what can only be received. This foreclosure is what we might call "sin" as existential posture: not the acceptance of a contaminated gift but the *metabolic failure* to receive the gift.

The gift arrives as pharmakon—not because it is inherently poisonous but because our inability to receive it can make it so. Desmond hints at this metabolic dimension: "We clot on ourselves again and close the porosity. The blood stream of life is made the carrier of death."[D331] The same encounter with being's overdeterminate richness can either open us to deeper community or close us off into "counterfeit doubles" of authentic transcendence. These are the refuges we construct to protect ourselves from our constitutional porosity—counterfeit affirmations that say "yes" without vulnerability, counterfeit wholes that prematurely resolve tension, counterfeit gods fashioned to our measure. What Lispector calls the "vital lie" tempts us precisely because it offers partial truths, domesticating the self in denial of its exposure to what exceeds it. The worse truth demands the breakdown of these often tempting doubles.

## The Violence of Grace

There is violence in grace—not cruelty, but the necessary destruction of what cannot withstand truth. Grace strikes like a knife, collapsing the 'familiar middle'—the counterfeit refuge built by conatus—and forcing us back into astonishment.

Lispector describes losing "a third leg that kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod."[L4] What provides stability also prevents genuine movement. The tripod of ordinary consciousness—grounded in self-certainty, conceptual mastery, and narrative coherence—keeps us upright but immobile. The violence of grace kicks away this third leg, forcing us to learn a terrifying new way of being.

The violence of grace occurs, yes, when we are somehow receptive to it. But perhaps it emerges from our ontological consent, which we already are. Our existential consent might struggle to undergo the ordeal but the original affirmation that we are calls us to transformation. We grow by being able to bear more of the totality, which includes the collapsing of our counterfeit refuges. Grace is then our alignment with the 'worse' truth. We accept the totality of light and dark because that is the truth of what is.

Nishitani calls this ordeal the *Great Death*—not physical death but the absolute negation of the ego-self that clings to its own being and its own meaning. It is the culmination of what Zen calls the Great Doubt, the radical questioning that presses itself to its existential limit. "The Great Doubt comes to light from the ground of our existence only when we press our doubts...to their limits as conscious acts of the doubting self. The Great Doubt represents not only the apex of the doubting self but also the point of its 'passing away' and ceasing to be 'self.'... This is also why it can be called the 'Great Death.'"[N21] The Great Death is the existential breakdown to be undergone. As the Zen saying put it: "In the Great Death heaven and earth become new."

This is the radical conversion from "the self is empty" to "emptiness is self"—a *metanoia*. While nihilism remains trapped in pure negation, experiencing emptiness as mere void, the conversion reveals emptiness itself as a generative, fertile, neutral ground—the field of śūnyatā over which *penia*-*sive*-*poros* are struck, porosity and poverty of the kenotic self made manifest.

This violence of grace strips away our constructions, revealing that the sense of agency itself dissolves. It's not a sense of otherness we discover but a sense of union through clear communication that turns into pure happening in which we are fully part. We become the process rather than standing outside observing it.

## Double Exposure and the Solitary One

What appears in this stripping bare is what Nishitani calls "double exposure"—reality appearing simultaneously under contradictory aspects without resolution. "The real Form of all things, including man, comes to be a 'double exposure' of life and death. All living things can be seen under the Form of death without thereby being separated from their proper Form of life."[N76]

This is not seeing death *instead* of life, nor dialectical synthesis. It is seeing life *and* death simultaneously, each fully present, neither canceling the other. This paradoxical structure finds philosophical articulation in Nishitani Keiji's usage of *soku-hi* (即非)—rendered by translator Jan van Bragt as *sive*—expressing radical interpenetration where seeming opposites mutually constitute each other. It captures something crucial: unlike "or" which separates or "and" which merely conjoins, *soku-hi* expresses simultaneity and mutual constitution. A-*sive*-B means A *is* B precisely in *not* being B. Each pole affirms itself through its relation to its opposite.[N-intro-xxx]

Lispector experiences this viscerally: "I was eating myself, I who am also living matter of the Sabbath"[L135]—simultaneously eating and being eaten, destroying and being destroyed, dying and being born. Life-*sive*-death in double exposure.

This logic extends beyond life and death to encompass the totality: *no*-*sive*-*yes*. We cannot affirm authentically without the capacity to negate; we cannot negate genuinely without something to affirm. The ordeal forces us into this unbearable totality—good-*sive*-evil, beautiful-*sive*-horrific, meaning-*sive*-meaninglessness. The "worse truth" cannot be domesticated into comfortable synthesis. We must undergo it in its terrible fullness.

Nishitani speaks of "the solitary one laid bare amidst the myriad phenomena"—and when we are stripped to essence, everything becomes more real. "In bearing witness to this solitary one laid bare, each and every phenomenon is by far more itself than it is on its own home-ground."[N199] The roach in its alien vitality, the neutral in its fertility, being itself in its astonishing thereness.

## Poros-*Sive*-Penia: The Structure of the Ordeal

Within the ordeal, we discover not mere blockage but a deeper structure: the interpenetration of poverty and passage, lack and opening. Lispector affirms this: "do not be afraid of neediness: it is our greater destiny."[L179] Neediness is not accidental to our being—it is our very structure in the midst of things.

*Penia* is poverty, lack, need—but not mere absence. Lispector articulates its paradoxical power: "The great emptiness in me shall be my place for existing; my extreme poverty shall be a great volition."[L158-159] The lack is not passive but active, generative, volitional.

*Poros* is passage, way, resource—but not straightforward path. As Desmond notes, *poros* carries connotations of "a way across," yet it is "a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way."[D41] The way opens by withdrawing. The passage creates space through its own recession.

Both *poros* and *penia* involve emptiness. They are not opposites but complementary movements of the same groundlessness. The hyphen in *poros*-*sive*-*penia* is crucial—not "*poros* or *penia*" but the radical interpenetration where each is the condition for the other's manifestation.

The words themselves reveal their kinship: *porous*, *poor*, *pore*. We are poor because we are porous, porous because we are poor. The pore is an opening, a passage through which things flow—neither pure emptiness nor pure fullness, but the space that allows both reaching and receiving. Poverty here is not mere lack but the constitutive openness of our being. To be porous is to be penetrable, vulnerable, exposed—and precisely in this exposure, to be capable of encounter, transformation, nourishment. Emptiness is not absence but the fertile space that makes presence possible.

This is the structure of the ordeal itself—we are suspended between emptiness that hungers and emptiness that opens. The ordeal intensifies our constitutional restlessness. We cannot rest in pure *penia*, for that way lies the madness of *eros turannos*—a consuming lack that can never be filled. Nor can we rest in pure *poros*, for that becomes a passive dissolution, a loss of self into the flow. The restlessness itself, this suspension between the two, strung across the emptiness between the hunger of *penia* and the opening of *poros*, *is* the energy of transformation.

## Sleepwalker's Courage and the Worse Truth

Lispector demonstrates what she calls sleepwalker's courage—the ability to move beyond the compulsive need to organize and reflect: "I was courageous like a sleepwalker who simply goes. During the hours of perdition I had the courage not to compose or organize. And above all not to look ahead."[L8]

She writes: "Perhaps what happened to me was an understanding—and for me to be true, I have to keep on being unable to grasp it, keep on not understanding it."[L8] The sleepwalker doesn't strategize each step; she allows herself to be moved by what she cannot consciously control. This is vulnerability as epistemological method—knowing that acknowledges the limits of autonomous reason while remaining open to forms of understanding that exceed those limits.

This leads to what she calls "the worse truth"[L53]—horrible not because it's false but because it confronts us with *totality*. The worse truth is the recognition that being gives itself as both beautiful and horrific, gift and ordeal, life-*sive*-death, without dialectical resolution. "Why would I be afraid of eating the good and the evil? if they exist that is because that is what exists."[L151]

And yet—here is the paradox—this worse truth is also "the best truth" because it is *truth*. It opens the possibility of what she calls "hopeless joy": not joy despite the lack of hope, but joy that has moved beyond hope's comforting illusions. Radical affirmation won from absolute negation.

## Consent Non-Consent

The ordeal brings us to a paradox: we must consent to what we cannot control, yield to what we would never choose. We are, as Desmond puts it, "the struggle between consent and refusal... consent as an overdeterminate trust in the basic goodness of being, or refusal as an indeterminate negation of, and dissent from, being as good at bottom."[D82] This is not a single decision but a violent oscillation, the very drama of the soul at the threshold of transformation.

The existential self, the *conatus*, recoils in terror. Faced with the dissolution of its constructed world—the kicking away of the "third leg"—its immediate response is refusal. This is the voice of legitimate fear, the organism's desperate attempt to preserve its integrity against what feels like annihilation. Lispector gives this voice its honest due: "I don't feel strong enough to stay disorganized".[L7] This is the existential "no," a frank admission of incapacity in the face of overwhelming excess.

And yet, this refusal is met with an equally powerful fascination. The terror is accompanied by a strange, irresistible pull toward the very thing that threatens to destroy it. To understand this push and pull, we must recognize that heteronomy—the intrusion of otherness—operates here in a crucial double register. On one hand, we are confronted by those exiled parts of ourselves we have foreclosed, aspects of our own being now seeking communication. This is the "other" that *can* be metabolized, the source of the *fascinans*, the pull toward homecoming. On the other hand, we are exposed to a genuine and irreducible otherness, both in the world and in the depths of our own ontological ground. This is the alterity that cannot be assimilated into a larger whole. It is the raw encounter with the infinite, the source of the *tremendum*, the terror of annihilation. To collapse these two—to treat all otherness as merely an alienated part of the self—is to fall into a Hegelian dialectic that ultimately domesticates the mystery. The metaxological ordeal insists that we remain a question to ourselves, constitutively open to what exceeds us even within our own being.

Torn between the terror of dissolution and the fascination of homecoming, the self thrashes. It is in this moment of unbearable tension that the counterfeit voice arrives, offering an escape. When the ordeal becomes too much, the mind scrambles to reassert control, to find a way out of the painful between. Lispector recognizes this mechanism with striking clarity: "It's hard to get lost," she admits. "It's so hard that I'll probably quickly figure out some way to find myself, even if finding myself is once again my vital lie."[L4] She knows she must be vigilant against the "new third leg that from me sprouts swiftly as weeds," a protective story she might call "'a truth.'"[L6] As Desmond warns, this is a moment of profound ambiguity and danger: "There is an asceticism of hatred; there is a purging of love; and hatred may speak the language of love."[D36] The most tempting counterfeit is the one that mimics the language of authentic surrender while secretly serving the agenda of the *conatus*.

Yet authentic consent is not passive collapse. The ordeal requires a double movement: both porosity and participation. We must *let* being work on us while actively *undergoing* the work. This is not contradiction but the paradox at the heart of metabolic transformation.

The double movement can be easily counterfeited in either direction. There is a passivity that dissolves into inertia—a "giving up" that mimics surrender while refusing the actual work of transformation. And there is a participation that becomes manic activity—restless doing that avoids the ordeal through constant motion, mistaking busyness for engagement. Between these false modes, authentic reception threads its narrow way: porous enough to let grace strike, engaged enough to metabolize what arrives.

This is consent as ontological alignment—not a decision made once but a sustained posture of active receptivity. It is learning to breathe with the ordeal rather than against it, to recognize that we are already being worked upon and that our task is not to resist or control but to *participate consciously* in our own transformation.

The ordeal continues until the existential self exhausts its capacity for refusal. The victory of the "yes" is not achieved through heroic willpower; it is realized through surrender. The struggle purges the "no" until what remains is the quiet, terrifying, and indestructible fact of the original affirmation that was there from the beginning. This is the consent that is not chosen but undergone, a "yes" that has been won from suffering and purged of all complaint.[D121]

This is what Nishitani means by the shift from "self is empty" to "emptiness is self"—the radical conversion where the void we feared becomes the very ground of our being. The Great Death reveals itself not as annihilation but as passage to what he calls the *Great Affirmation*: the standpoint of śūnyatā where all things manifest in their suchness, "just as they are." What appeared as negation—the stripping away of the ego's constructions—reveals itself as the condition for a more fundamental affirmation. Not the naive "yes" of unreflective existence, nor the desperate "yes" of the conatus seeking security, but the resurrected "yes" that has passed through absolute negation and emerged transfigured.

It is only from this place of exhausted surrender that the final, transformative act can occur.

## Somatic Consent

The ordeal reveals a split that our intellectualism obscures. The mind can only pose an existential frame—it operates in the realm of meaning, narrative, constructed identity. It builds what Desmond calls "counterfeit doubles": conceptual refuges that protect us from our constitutional porosity. The mind is the domain of *conatus essendi*, forever seeking to master, to filter, to make reality digestible.

But the body knows the ontological frame. The body does not debate whether to participate in being—it breathes, it hungers, it metabolizes, it dies. These are not concepts but lived realities that cannot be refused. The body *is* the *passio essendi*: always already given, always already exposed, always already consenting to what exceeds it. We are porous not as metaphor but as biological fact. Every breath is an exchange with non-self.

The mind constructs narratives of autonomy and control, but the body remains stubbornly relational, dependent, open. This creates the tension at the heart of the ordeal: the mind can refuse what the body has already accepted. The existential self recoils while the organism continues its metabolic participation in being. We can foreclose the gift in our mind while it lives on in the body.

What the mind has banished to preserve its illusion of sovereignty—the horror, the neutral, the finitude—does not simply disappear. It continues to live in the soma, unmetabolized. The things we cannot think accumulate in the body. What has been foreclosed from consciousness must be physically processed. The crisis becomes somatic because the refusal has been somatic.

The body lives what Nishitani describes as *soku-hi*—the radical interpenetration of opposites. In breathing, we are simultaneously taking in and giving out, life-*sive*-death in a single movement. In every metabolic process, self and other exchange without fusion. The body enacts the metaxu that the mind struggles to comprehend. It *is* the between-space where being communicates.

When Nishitani speaks of our self being "most elementally middle,"[N165] he names what Desmond calls the metaxu. These are not parallel insights but two names, from different traditions, for the same groundless ground. The body's heteronomy enacts what both philosophers articulate: we are not autonomous origins but metabolic middles, porous participants in a field that is simultaneously empty (*śūnyatā*) and communicative (*metaxu*).

The ordeal forces a reckoning with this split. The violence of grace does strips away the illusions that have clotted our porosity. The mind must be brought to where the body has always been: exposed, dependent, open to what exceeds it. This is why the climax of the ordeal is visceral, why it manifests as purge. The body takes over where consciousness fails, physically expelling what cannot be mentally integrated. What cannot be thought must be sweated, cried, vomited.

## The Purge: Metabolic Climax

The moment arrives. Lispector recognizes what must happen: "Redemption had to be in the thing itself," which means "putting into my mouth the white paste of the roach."[L172-174] She calls it "the anti-sin," but one that comes "at the price of traversing a sensation of death." She rises "with the determination not of a suicide but of a murderer of myself."

The sweat begins—not ordinary perspiration but something primordial, "a sweat I didn't recognize and that smelled like what comes from dried-up earth after the first rains." She's swimming now in her "oldest primeval soup," the sweat as "plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae." She has become the process: "I was being, I was me being." This is metabolic wisdom unfolding—the body knows before the mind what transformation requires. Then the first purge is violent and entire: "I suddenly threw up the milk and bread I had eaten for breakfast... I had vomited the exaltation." The body expels what cannot be metabolized, including the very spiritual state that would have made the act bearable, forcing her to approach it "physically simple as a girl."

She eats, but not through will or consciousness. The act happens in dizziness, in a space where she has "removed from myself all participation," having "not wanted 'to know.'" Afterward, she reflects: "So that was how things were processed? 'Not knowing'—so that was how the deepest things happened?... Was the secret of never escaping from the greater life living like a sleepwalker?"[L173-174]

Then the second purge, the spitting. "I now felt the nastiness in my mouth, and then began to spit, to furiously spit that taste of no such thing." The Apocalypse verse surfaces: "because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth." But she discovers: "The neutral thing is extremely energetic, I was spitting and it was still I." She cannot expel the neutral because the neutral is what she is.

When we allow this—when we participate in rather than resist the purge—we restore porosity. The channels that had clotted reopen. We find ourselves alive in the hyperbole. Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming, Sighing. The grammar of the *metaxu* revealed in full intensity—a language of pure verbs, of pure happening. The sovereign "I" dissolves. There is no longer an "I" who weeps or laughs. There is simply Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming.

## Reality as Communication

What is real is what communicates to us—what makes contact. Lispector discovers this in the ordeal: direct communication with being becomes more real than any conceptual overlay. "All sudden understanding is finally the revelation of an acute incomprehension."[L8] The communication exceeds our capacity to grasp it conceptually, communicating its incommunications, revelation and concealment in a single movement.

Reality is combinatorially explosive, echoing John Vervaeke. We cannot process every quality, every aspect, every relata. We must filter, select, make intelligible what would otherwise overwhelm us. The very act of making something intelligible—rendering it legible, coherent, graspable—makes it appear as true. We trust the clearly formatted page, the coherent narrative, the comprehensible concept. Intelligibility becomes our criterion for reality.

Yet the ordeal reveals that communication operates beyond this frame. Both hyperintelligibility (excessive meaning that overwhelms) and the neutral (stripped of imposed meaning) communicate truths our filtering had excluded. The hyperintelligible reveals deeper truth precisely by overwhelming us, forcing acknowledgment of our finitude before the glory that exceeds our grasp. This is not failure of communication but its perfection—we are claimed by what we cannot master.

To be in communication with reality is to allow oneself to be claimed by what shows itself, to receive what cannot be fully processed. This is why Lispector insists: "Creating isn't imagination, it's taking the great risk of grasping reality."[L12] Imagination offers refuge—we can shape it, control it, keep it within our metabolic capacity. But reality communicates on its own terms, and to receive that communication is to undergo transformation.

The incapacity to receive this communication is metabolic failure. Not a psychological repression but an ontological foreclosure—the channels have clotted. We remain in contact with reality, but the contact registers as unbearable because we cannot metabolize what it offers. The horror, the absurd, emerges not from reality's meaninglessness but from our inability to bear its excess. Every attempt at comprehension becomes "an acute incomprehension" because we are trying to grasp from within the very closure that blocks reception.

Lispector recognizes, finally: "The divine for me is whatever is real."[L175] Not the transcendent, not the beautiful, not even the meaningful—but the real itself, in its terrible and fertile neutrality. This is the fruit of metabolic transformation: reality becomes luminous precisely as reality. The real no longer needs to be made intelligible, legible, comprehensible to be worthy of attention. It communicates directly in its suchness.

And then the admission: "I understood that, by placing in my mouth the paste of the roach, I was not stripping myself as the saints do, but was once again yearning for the accretion. The accretion is easier to love."[L178] Even the most radical gesture risks becoming counterfeit—seeking more when what's needed is acceptance of what already communicates. But this recognition itself is metabolic wisdom: seeing how the drive to accumulate, to accrete meaning, infiltrates even our most sincere attempts at receiving the simple real.

The violence of grace strips away our constructions, our filters, our comfortable criteria of intelligibility. What remains is not nothing but a transformed capacity for reception. In the ruins of the familiar middle, in the metabolized ordeal, something new emerges: a knowing that has learned to dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

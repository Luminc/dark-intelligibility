## Notes

The book appears to have sparsely marked section breaks with all-caps titles.

**PDF Text Formatting:** The section titles in the PDF have unusual spacing between letters:
- Appears as: "N EUTRAL   CRAFTING   OF   LIFE"
- Should read as: "THE NEUTRAL CRAFTING OF LIFE"

**Structure:** The narrative is largely continuous with occasional section markers rather than traditional chapter breaks.

## To Complete This List

**Recommended approach:**
1. Flip through your Penguin physical copy
2. Look for pages where a new section starts with an all-caps title
3. Note the Penguin page number
4. Add to this list

**Alternative:** Use the PDF and search for pages where the text starts with multiple capital letters in sequence.

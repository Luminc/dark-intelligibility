# Meditation, Ambiguity, and the Pharmakon of Being

*A synthesis of insights on spiritual practice, scientific reductionism, and the fundamental ambiguity of transformation*

---

## The Core Problem: Meditation as Commodity vs. Ontological Practice

**My Insight**: The problem with framing meditation as a 'relaxation technique' or a 'health promoting technique' that is common from the psychology/scientific perspective immediately strips it of its ontological and existential stakes. Meditation becomes a **product**—a stress reliever, a performance booster, a wellness brand.

**The Fundamental Error**: When framed this way, any deviation from marketed benefits is pathologized as *user error* or *pre-existing condition*. This represents **capitalism over ambiguity**—a "brand defense" orientation that refuses to acknowledge the **pharmakon** nature of spiritual practice.

## The Pharmakon of Being: Medicine and Poison

**Key Recognition**: **The fundamental ambiguity of being is the medicine that is taken.** Meditation should not be a refuge from existential dread—it should inquire into the root of those things. Yet it is precisely in **equivocal waters where the biggest shifts in our perception occur, for good or for bad**.

**The Crux**: If we are not aligned to being, then meditation practice might further exacerbate our condition. The **harm being the benefit** is not a bug but a feature—though this requires mature guidance within established traditions rather than commodified practices.

**Against False Analogies**: The comparison to the tobacco industry is a category error. Tobacco is inherently toxic. Meditation is a **practice of relation** that opens people to reality—and reality, especially inner reality, is often ambiguous, painful, and destabilizing.

## The Scientific Reduction: Cartesian Dualism in Spiritual Research

**The Problem with Britton's Framework**: While acknowledging meditation's ambiguity is important, the scientific approach remains trapped in **Cartesian dualism**—subject vs. object, brain vs. behavior, healthy vs. pathological. This **univocalizing view** cannot think non-dually.

**William James's Similar Error**: Despite honoring the multiplicity of religious experience, James maintained the **observer/observed split** and treated experiences as **data points** rather than **participatory encounters with being**.

**The Deeper Issue**: Scientific critique of toxic spiritual communities becomes a **deeper dismissal of metaphysical inquiry itself** because it doesn't fit measurable frameworks. From this perspective, **ambiguity is a bug**, not a feature.

## Beyond Pathology: Wholeness vs. Wellness

**True Contemplative Traditions**: These aim at **wholeness**, not wellness. This includes sickness, suffering, confusion, even madness. The **shadow is not something to be eliminated, but integrated**.

**The YouTube Wisdom**: "Only scientists could pathologize sitting and doing nothing"—this captures the irony of a worldview that only understands things in terms of function, pathology, and outcome.

**Initiatory Understanding**: The **biggest perceptual shifts happen in equivocal waters**. The liminal space, the in-between, where identity loses its grip and the world opens up. This is dangerous terrain, yes. But also sacred. Initiatory. Fertile.

## Cultural Diagnosis: The Lack of Metabolic Capacity

**The Real Problem**: Modern society has **neither the myths, metaphors, nor institutions** to hold people who undergo destabilization. Without robust tradition (sangha, spiritual guide), people are left flailing.

**World Frame Sickness**: In a world frame that is already sick, it is not surprising that people would fall more sick in meditation or any other practice. The harm is often not in the practice but in **the way our culture lacks the ability to honor or metabolize transformation**.

**Call for Spiritual Maturity**: We desperately need **ritual containers**, **philosophical depth**, and **existential courage** to meet the ambiguity that meditation reveals.

## Vervaeke vs. Britton: Participatory vs. Clinical

**Vervaeke's Advantage**: While also noting meditation's dangers, Vervaeke approaches it through **relevance realization** and **reciprocal opening**—about **aligning ourselves with the depth and ambiguity of being itself**. This is more **phenomenological, participatory, dialogical**.

**Britton's Limitation**: Remains committed to a **medical-epistemic model** that treats experience as **objectifiable**—something **a subject has** rather than an emergent relation **within being**.

## Desmond's Metaxological Alternative

**Against Univocity**: Desmond's **metaxological** approach recognizes being as **overdetermined**, with human existence lived "in between" (metaxu) the immanent and transcendent. Intense meditative experiences are **threshold events** where finite touches infinite.

**Disclosive Rather Than Adverse**: Even terrifying experiences may be **gifts of the between**, revealing our dependence on an origin that exceeds us. The **trembling before being** is a mark not of disorder, but of **truthful receptivity**.

**The Pharmakon Insight**: As Desmond would say, to truly approach being is to enter a space where **the harm might be the healing**—both poison and cure, depending on our capacity to receive what exceeds us.

## The Permeability Problem: Dissolution vs. Centering in Emptiness

**What's so bad about being permeable?** The threat of dissolution is none to those centered in emptiness. Death, ultimately, is present in our daily self-negation, colonization, oppression, and other various forms of relatas and stratas that already constrain and diminish us.

**Eros Tyrannical vs. Eros Heavenly**: In the fundamental ambiguity of eros to be both possessive, transformative, and destructive lies a desire that determines a certain telos we move towards. In fact, **permeable to the telos, we are drawn towards it**. The question becomes: which eros dominates our spiritual practice?

**The Conatus Problem**: The **conatus essendi**—our striving to persist in being—lies at the heart of the problem. The limits of self-determination are acutely felt by a being whose potentialities are isolated in a devalued ethos no longer able to make connections because all the relations are already ossified.

**Beyond Self-Preservation**: When we are already dying through systemic oppression, spiritual bypassing, and cultural metabolic failure, the fear of dissolution through genuine practice becomes a false protection. True permeability to the sacred becomes a form of liberation from the living death of a colonized consciousness.

## Practical Implications

**Tradition Matters**: The danger of Western commodification is the removal of practices from traditions that understand their **fundamental ambiguity**. Good practitioners should inform and guide people within established contemplative frameworks.

**Case-by-Case Discernment**: Where lies the illness? It depends on context—the person's alignment with being, their support structures, their metabolic capacity for transformation.

**Safety Without Reduction**: People with PTSD need bigger safety nets and shouldn't expect meditation alone to provide therapy. But this doesn't mean reducing spiritual practice to therapeutic technique.

## Conclusion: The Necessity of Ambiguity

**Final Recognition**: A truthful spiritual practice should include the whole spectrum, good and bad. The **fundamental ambiguity of any practice** (or medicine) is not something to be eliminated but engaged with **finesse rather than geometry**.

**Cultural Task**: We need frameworks that can hold both the **risks and the necessity** of spiritual transformation—recognizing that some breakdowns (kenosis, dark nights) are crucial **gifts of being** rather than pathological symptoms.

The pharmakon of being cannot be resolved through scientific taxonomy but must be lived, metabolized, and integrated through **mature spiritual practice** within **wisdom traditions** that understand transformation's necessarily **equivocal waters**.

# Companionability and Possession


>*"I really like things I don't understand. When I read a thing I don't understand, I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo."*
>—Clarice Lispector, *A Breath of Life* [Lb29]

I should disorganize, and yet structure simultaneously. I should create meta-structures that can kiss disorganization here and there.

What has language done for me, for better and worse? Or perhaps more precisely: How does the determined become companionable to indeterminacy? How do light and dark conjoin in *chiaroscuro*?
And how to develop the metabolic capacity to receive the chiaroscuro, to affirm their interpenetration? This requires more than intellectual understanding; it demands a transformation of our very relation to being.

Today, in a world where ambiguity dominates and social cohesion evaporates, the demands of life hijack our capacity to remain open. I must be compassionate here. It is no surprise that we foreclose our porosity. Faced with real suffering, oppression, and the devaluation of being, a lack of meaning can feel like a terminal diagnosis. What results is not some heroic, radical subjectivity, but a quiet death—the death of community with others, and more devastatingly, the death of communication with ourselves, with our own being. The stakes, then, are not philosophical, but vital: our lives, our health. The question that presses upon me, the one I cannot avoid, is how can we possibly remain porous in a sick world? How do we find the strength to let things in when so much of what is outside is toxic? Let us stop trying to make sense of it for a moment, and instead, try to feel our way into the question itself.

I have to confess I cannot be honest to you, dear reader. I'm not sure I have the capacity to speak truth to myself, truth to power, or anything. I'm in love yes, and I will follow that flame. But I don't know what I can contribute.

Maybe this essay will be some half-unfinished regurgitation, unmetabolized material, purged from a system that is processing, messy, academically questionable, of questionable authenticity. On the page I should not shy from truth as I do not do so in my body, my soul. I encounter myself fully. But of course I'm full of my own bullshit too.

Writing itself becomes a site of perplexity and astonishment. Perhaps in an attempt give myself breath, to give myself space to wonder and attend to myself. Not as achievement but as necessity, an attempt to save my life. I want to connect even more deeply to the world for as long as I will have energy to do so.

Words do not come easy at times, so we let them be. It is natural not to know the way, so we should become lost. If there is one thing clear I can say about myself, it is that I'm lost. I find things, things happen to me, but I am groundless, like a cell breaking open, its contents spilling out. Disorganization can be messy. Words should be able to breathe. We can run into blockages and aporia, and what do we do? Give up? Hunt further? Or let it breathe? Aporia, I'm finding, is companionable to the going, sweetly abysmal as it is. What appears as a dead-end becomes, for the patient, the site where new passages open.

And yet there remains the bare fact that I am here at all. That anything is at all. Before we become, we are first given to be. This remains our *original astonishment*: we are thrown into the midst of the sheer that-it-is of being.

How can I write without knowing where to go? I shall have somebody else write through me. Starting with my parental voices, Clarice Lispector and William Desmond.

Heteronomy is the intrusion autonomy tries to prevent. We encounter the other, framed as an intrusion. If it's not capable of being dominated, at least made manageable. We foreclose true encounter with the other, but the relations remain and with it the potential for another break.

The other intrudes in myself as well. In my voice, my very being, there is a whole host of voices speaking through me.

Even writing can surprise us as the words appear on the page as if coming from a foreign source. The text appears as if coming from beyond me.

It is certainly astonishing that we, such porous interconnected beings, think of ourselves as autonomous. In ourselves there seems a dispersal of agency, focused on the other. At any given moment I am possessed by voices not my own, and yet somehow I still say "I."

My body feels like I should inhabit the writing as practice, poetry and philosophy. I will write fragments, like I write here. I feel easily possessed. This doesn't have to be a problem. Maybe the horde of voices coalesces in a full and emptied coherence, until something singular appears. Not out of erotic desire but love, of deepest intimacy and companionship.

I will write as a lover who falls in love at first sight and is completely pre-occupied with her beloved. But I'm also searching, searching for a resonance in the tuning fork of being.

*Cum panis* indeed. Following Desmond's sense of the open whole, do we arrive at a liberated autonomy? An autonomy that knows itself to be plurivocal and connected to others? Perhaps such freedom emerges by transformation of our relation to the other—to undergo the ordeal of being claimed by what exceeds us, until the intrusion reveals itself as gift. Can we come companionable to what threatens to possess and destroy us?



My desire for possession comes not from a desire for self-dissolution but for recognizing interdependence and flowing in the river. What freedom would that give? It could be radical.

The body writes. It has written for a few thousand years, a page in our evolutionary techgnosis now quickly being abandoned for the keyboard and screen. If we consider writing the techno-pharmakon par excellence, we cannot underestimate the power of a trembling hand scribbling thoughts to the page as if the line were its very consciousness. This is why I still love the pen, the physical act of writing. I feel too disconnected from the digital process, where even beautiful life drawings remain inert files. There is a different flow when you actually draw the words, a mediaticity in physical ink that I am reluctant to lose.

Today it felt urgent to work but it also felt urgent to disorganize.

I was playful in letting Lispector and Desmond together with me make us into a triangle. Geometric stability through threeness, yet each point remains irreducible. Not synthesis but constellation.

Both Desmond and Clarice are enactive of what they write about. It is a lived philosophy after all. Porosity requires that intimacy, that vulnerability of expression in the midst of things. I want to get to the threshold of both thinkers. The aim here is not a perfect synthesis, which would risk domesticating the radical singularity of each voice. Rather, it is to stage a tense and improvisational tango where resonance emerges from the space opened up between them. Hopefully I will not be a wallflower.

I am a sponge—I allow plurivocity to color me. The concepts presented here are hard-won, brought forth not from a place of mastery but through sustained perplexity and help from others.

The body writes. There is a restlessness there, one that is not accidental but constitutional. We are restless because we are the between—neither pure lack (*penia*) nor pure resource (*poros*). This is the restlessness of the *poros-sive-penia* structure, and it drives both the writing and the transformation. This disorganization felt urgent, and it worked. But the danger is tying disorganization and productivity to any external means, lest we become too dependent. We are not independent—we allow heteronomy to affect our writing as well.

However, this disorganization and productivity is dangerous to be tied to any single source. Since I am not independent, I flow with the interdependence. But I must remain vigilant.

Other voices can feel prosthetic. It feels somehow shameful. I feel like I'm not trying to actually undergo true vulnerability. Thinking about things often helps us avoid actually dealing with life. I'm too scared to be genuinely authentic. Take this text with a grain of salt. I should stop trying to be intelligible and practice what I preach. I don't have to make myself intelligible. Lispector refuses. I can have my secrets too.

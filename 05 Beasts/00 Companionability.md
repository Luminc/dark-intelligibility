# Companionability

>*"I really like things I don't understand. When I read a thing I don't understand, I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo."*
>—Clarice Lispector, *A Breath of Life*

How do we relate to what ultimately concerns us? We are thrown into reality's whirl without ground, without given orientation. The religious traditions once held these ultimate questions—the meaning of existence, our stance toward being, the ground of value itself. But today we delegate our ultimate concerns to the background, occupying ourselves with anything but the direct encounter with being itself. The result of this deferral, this devaluation of being, is nihilism.

Nihilism appears first as ending, as the collapse into meaninglessness. But it may be doorway rather than dead end, an essential waystation toward transformed relation to being. Our coming to nothing—if we can bear to remain there rather than flee—hollows out a space where something new might be born from the ruins.

This requires that we stop trying to make sense of it, that we feel our way into the question itself. The determined must somehow become companionable to indeterminacy. How does light and dark conjoin in *chiaroscuro*? We need metabolic capacity to receive this interpenetration, to digest what threatens to poison us.

Today, in a world where ambiguity dominates and social cohesion evaporates, the demands of life can overwhelm our capacity to remain open. I must be compassionate here—with myself, with us. It is no surprise that we foreclose our porosity. Faced with real suffering, oppression, the devaluation of being, a lack of meaning can feel like terminal diagnosis. The temptation is to close off, to protect. What results is not some heroic refusal, but a quiet death—the death of community with others, and more devastatingly, the death of communication with ourselves, with our own being.

I have to confess I cannot be honest to you, dear reader. I'm not sure I have the capacity to tell you the truth. I follow the flame called love and I try to discern in its light, the gradations of color, the intensity of its burning. Everything I believe can be told by the flame of a single candle. Maybe this essay will be some half-unfinished regurgitation, unmetabolized material, purged from a system that is processing, messy, academically questionable, of questionable authenticity. On the page I should not shy from truth as I do not do so in my body, my soul. I encounter myself fully. But of course I'm full of my own bullshit too.

Writing itself becomes a site of perplexity and astonishment. It is an attempt to give myself breath, to give myself space to wonder and attend to myself. Not as achievement but as necessity, an attempt to save my life.

How can I write without knowing where to go? I shall have somebody else write through me. In my voice, my very being, there is a whole host of voices speaking through me. I feel easily possessed. This doesn't have to be a problem. Starting with my parental voices, Clarice Lispector and William Desmond. I was playful in letting Lispector and Desmond together with me make us into a triangle. Geometric stability through threeness, yet each point remains irreducible. Not synthesis but constellation.
The aim here is not a perfect synthesis, which would risk domesticating the radical singularity of each voice. Rather, it is to stage a tense and improvisational tango where resonance emerges from the space opened up between them. Hopefully I will not be a wallflower.

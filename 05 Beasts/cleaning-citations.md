  Standard Academic Approaches

  1. Single Comprehensive Note (Most Common)

  Place one note at the beginning of the extended analysis:

  53. The following analysis of the purge scene draws on Lispector,
  The Passion According to G.H., 172–74, with specific page references
  given parenthetically.

  Then in the text itself, put page numbers in parentheses:
  - "She rises 'with the determination not of a suicide but of a murderer of myself' (172)."
  - "The sweat is 'plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae' (173)."

  2. Comprehensive Note at Section End

  Put the note at the end of "The Purge: Metabolic Climax" section:

  This section draws extensively on Lispector's account of eating the roach
  in The Passion According to G.H., 172–74.

  3. Hybrid Approach (Best for your case)

  For a section this rich with direct quotations, I'd suggest:

  - First citation (note 53): Full reference
  - Subsequent quotes from same pages: Parenthetical (173)
  - New important point: Add "Idem." note only when needed for emphasis
  - Limit to 3-4 total notes for the whole section

  Recommendation for Your Text

  Looking at your "Purge: Metabolic Climax" section (pages 34-38 in the PDF), I'd consolidate to perhaps 3-4 notes maximum:

  1. Opening note establishing you're analyzing pp. 172-74
  2. Maybe one "Idem" for a particularly important pivot point
  3. Final quote if it's from a different page

  This is standard practice in close reading / explication de texte style scholarship. Readers understand that when you're doing extended textual analysis, you're working with the same passage throughout.

  Would you like me to help restructure that section's citations using this approach?

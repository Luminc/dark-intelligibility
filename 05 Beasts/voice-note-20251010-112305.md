Philosophy and the Intimate Universal Not only the upward ascent to the good, but in the downward descent into the cave again. For the dark of the cave requires the night vision of the philosopher. A Breath of Life I really like the things I don't understand. When I read a thing I don't understand, I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo. End quote, page 29. I should disorganize, and yet structure simultaneously. I should create metastructures that can kiss disorganization here and there. I love the pen. I'm too disconnected from the physical process of writing. There is a different flow when you actually draw the words. What has language done for me? Surely it is not the question. It's rather, how does the determined become companionable to the indeterminacy? How light and dark conjoin in chiaroscuro? In a world where ambiguity dominates and social cohesion evaporates, and too much meaning exists, univocal, equivocal, or otherwise, there is still the stage of self-determination which demands attention. The spectacle. Being is communicative, but it is inseparable from non-being. I seem to be spinning around dualities again. There remains the urgency for fidelity to their conjunctions and interpenetrations. However, the demands and libidinal economies of lies hijack our capacity to open to them. End quote. And I know that this seems familiar. Let us stop making sense for a moment and try to delve deeper. Words do not come easy at times, so we let them be. It is natural to not know the way. So we should become lost. If there is one thing clear I can say about myself, it's that I'm lost. I find things, things happen to me, but I'm groundless, like a cell breaking open with its contents spilling out. Disorganization can be messy. How can I write without knowing where to go? I shall have somebody else write through me. Starting with my parental voices. Clarice Lispector and William Desmond. The rule of the other. Heteronomy is the intrusion autonomy tries to prevent. Just think of the nationalist immigration panic. But the other, if not capable to be dominated, at least made manageable. The other intrudes. The other intrudes in myself as well. In my voice, my very being, there is a whole host of voices speaking through me. It is certainly astonishing that we are such porous interconnected beings that think of themselves as autonomous. At any given moment I am possessed by voices not my own. Quote. I only use reason as an anesthetic. End quote. Page 36. Quote. As in a scandal. End quote. Page 36. The scandal of reality is connected to the idiocy. The sheer that it is. The ambiguity. The scandal highlights the flip side of the miracle. It contains its controversial, secretive, difficult to reconcile. Truly. Reality as happening is astonishing and excessive. Hence the designation as a scandal. I too must have turned down a dead end alley just like the others. End quote. Page 36. The author in Breath of Life seems to manage and edit Angela. Quote. I control her as much as I can, deleting her merely foolish comments. End quote. Page 39. This positions them in a plurivocal relationship with autonomy dispersed. A chaotic Angela is edited by the author, allowed to come into existence on her own terms, but relational, confined to a post hoc past of the author in a different modality. Quote. Traveling through this book while keeping Angela company is tricky. End quote. Page 39. Quote. Author. I'd like to, quote, cure her, end quote, of herself. But her, in fact, is not. Quote. I'd like to, quote, cure her, end quote, of herself. End quote. Page 39. But her sickness is stronger than my powers. End quote. Page 42. Quote. From now on I want more than understanding. I want super understanding. Dot dot dot. I want to reach the most intimate secret of whatever exists. Dot dot dot. End quote. Page 42. This seems like hubris, but super understanding and reaching secrets do not imply that the secret is unlocked. Maybe only intimately acknowledged. Not even a secret. Maybe only plainly diagnostic. Not understanding our existence. Not understanding what we have stood before. Not understanding the nature or model of our existence. Not understanding with your mind how you would have lived 이게... Not understanding through what we do or what your competencies only in order to live this nature. Know, may I be able to introduce measures of piercing more than just action that may solution in the light simplest of types. Notjąn know. Proposeante. I'll tell you if I haven't done everything correctly. Or not. Know and derive. Lighten up a little. Make you happy. And you also get some for all eitherDon't. Pay attention. Problem. Make you部 a day or two. One piece for me to follow. Not to point fingers. It seems logical our drive for survival becomes exacted in our drive for self-determination. Our hypertrophic conatus seems to be rooted in the same mechanisms that stimulate our survival, namely stress and other bodily feedback. It can be compared to a trauma victim whose nervous system cannot turn off and is always in a state of threat. Since the overall structure of the brain has developed sequentially through time, we become victims of the same primal structures in place for millions of years.

The fundamental ambiguity of being is what I approach through the concept of the **Pharmakon of Being**. At once medicine and poison, the degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our 'metabolic capacity' for our ordeals. This capacity refers not merely to our intellectual understanding, but to our fundamental ability to digest reality in its unfiltered form—what Clarice Lispector calls the "saltless" truth.

 But the "saltless" truth is inhuman, without any trace of human sentiment. It's what Lispector encounters in the neutral gaze of the roach—reality before it has been processed through our interpretive apparatus. Saltless is a neutral through which we encounter things on their homeground. 

In Lispector's *The Passion According to G.H.*, she confronts this ambiguity precisely: "How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation... to being." She confronts the fear deeply without trying to solve it, for the unknown as well as mysterious and sublime is terrifying. The violence of grace disorients the notion of self, placing us in the strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged.

"For salt I had always been ready, salt was the transcendence that I used to experience a taste, and to flee what I was calling 'nothing,'" Lispector writes. "But what my mouth wouldn't know how to understand—was the saltless." Salt becomes our pharmakon—it preserves and makes palatable, but also distances us from direct encounter with being's naked actuality.

Lispector's "neutral" is paradoxically charged with its own vitality—what she calls "the great living neutrality struggling." It's not dead neutrality but **fertile neutrality**—neutral in its refusal to conform to human categories, yet generative in ways that exceed our usual notions of meaning.

The neutral gives her participation in what she calls "hopeless joy"—joy that doesn't convert into hope, that remains at the level of pure affirmation without projected futures or redemptive narratives. It's joy in suchness, in the bare fact that anything is at all. This is joy that has learned to metabolize neutrality without converting it into something else.

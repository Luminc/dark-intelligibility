### Porosity and the Neutral

"The World had always been humanized. Now I was before the inhuman. The neutral was what was intimate." [^1] Clarice Lispector's narrator in The Passion According to G.H. encounters an intimacy that is not warm, not consoling, but alien. Intimacy here is not the communion of similarity, but the piercing proximity of otherness. The cockroach, that abject creature, tears through the membrane of her constructed self. She confronts what she calls "the great living neutrality struggling", life stripped of its human face, vitality indifferent to meaning.

William Desmond offers a striking parallel in his book the God and the Between: "The idiocy of being is the sheer astonishment that there is anything at all, its intimate givenness and its foreign neutrality."[^3] What Lispector calls the neutral

Both Lispector and Desmond refuse a hard subject/object split and insist on the self as porous. Both testify that intimacy is not found in familiarity but in strangeness. Not only do we try to determine external reality as other into an intelligible familiarity, but the same process if occurs in the self. The essential moment is when the depths of selving reveal the alterity in our own being. When the constructions about the self break down something else shines through. 

Others are perhaps most alive in us when we are alive to our own alterity. But as we see the other as a threat to overcome, from the point of autonomy, the other is secondary, to be dominated and exploited. 

Both the neutral and the inhuman speak of a return to a mode of being prior to human conceptualization. Prior to objectification and subjectivation. Lispector's "neutral" is paradoxically charged with its own vitality—what she calls "the great living neutrality struggling." It's not a dead neutrality but fertile—neutral in its refusal to conform to human categories, yet generative in ways that exceed our usual notions of meaning. For Desmond, this connects to the passion/patience of being, the passio essendi: "We are given to be before we give ourselves to be. There is a passio essendi, a patience of being, more primordial than our conatus essendi, our endeavor to be."[^2]

"For salt I had always been ready, salt was the transcendence that I used to experience a taste, and to flee what I was calling 'nothing,'" Lispector writes. "But what my mouth wouldn't know how to understand—was the saltless." A salt analogous to our filters and constructions—it preserves and makes palatable, but also distances us from direct encounter with being's naked actuality.

The neutral gives her participation in what she calls "hopeless joy"—joy that doesn't convert into hope, that remains at the level of pure affirmation without projected futures or redemptive narratives. It's joy in suchness, in the bare fact that anything is at all. This is joy that has learned to metabolize neutrality without converting it into something else.

The fundamental ambiguity of being is what I approach through the concept of the **Pharmakon of Being**. At once medicine and poison, the degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our 'metabolic capacity' for our ordeals. This capacity refers not merely to our intellectual understanding, but to our fundamental ability to digest reality in its unfiltered form—what Clarice Lispector calls the "saltless" truth.

 But the "saltless" truth is inhuman, without any trace of human sentiment. It's what Lispector encounters in the neutral gaze of the roach—reality before it has been processed through our interpretive apparatus. Saltless is a neutral through which we encounter things on their homeground. 

In Lispector's *The Passion According to G.H.*, she confronts this ambiguity precisely: "How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation... to being." She confronts the fear deeply without trying to solve it, for the unknown as well as mysterious and sublime is terrifying. The violence of grace disorients the notion of self, placing us in the strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged.

# Dark Intelligibility: The Fruits of Transformation

>"Not dark but just without light."[L89]

The ordeal of the pharmakon culminates not in a final answer, but in a restored capacity for relation. The communication born from the purge deepens into something more intimate: communion. The fruit of the ordeal is not a new set of propositions about the world, but a new way of knowing that is closer to a form of touch—an *unknowing-sive-knowing* that feels like an encounter with the divine. This is metabolic knowing, and it ripens into a way of being that is both profoundly intelligent and radically loving.

## Part 1: The Nature of Metabolic Knowing

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. An understanding emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. This is the domain of *dark intelligibility*, a knowing that operates by giving equal weight to the day of reason and the night of mystery. As William Desmond suggests, our daytime reason risks going mad if it cannot return to and draw nourishment from the mystery of the night. Like bats in sunlight, our conceptual mind is blinded by the very excess of being, the very source of light.

The terror of Lispector's ordeal—the encounter with the neutral, the saltless, the "thing-part"—is the terror of metabolizing a fundamental, ontological truth. It is a direct encounter with what Desmond's metaphysics describes as the shadow of our createdness. Because creation is *ex nihilo*, the finite universe is constitutively "shadowed by the nothingness (*nihilo*) from which it was made" [Db269]. This is not a moral failing but our structural condition. The violence of grace is the force that compels us to confront this shadow, to taste the `nihilo` woven into our being. This is made present in Lispector's own words: "I don’t want it. But I cannot help feeling all enlarged inside myself by the poverty of the opaque and the neutral: the thing is alive like weeds. And if that is hell, it is heaven itself: the choice is mine. I am the one who shall be demonic or angel; if I am demonic, this is hell; if I am angel, this is heaven" [L159].

Here lies the crucial pass-through, the bridge between a Western metaphysical tradition and an Eastern contemplative one. We must confront the terror of the `nihilo`—our own contingent, dependent nothingness—to discover the freedom of `sunyata`, the fertile emptiness that Nishitani Keiji names. The `nihilo` is the door; `sunyata` is the room. This discovery is grounded in what Nishitani calls *ontological samadhi*: a deep stillness and knowing at our core that persists even through the most violent turbulence. Dark intelligibility is learning to think *from* this recovered ground.

This knowing is not anti-rational but *hyperrational*—reason stretched to its creative limits until it becomes praise. It is what Desmond calls *thought singing its Other*. Lispector's final words capture this perfectly: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it." [L175]. Comprehension is surrendered for communion.

## Part 2: The Ongoing Practice of Bearing More

This transformation is not a static achievement but an ongoing practice: the practice of bearing more. It is the development of a spiritual metabolism robust enough to process reality's "murky bile" as well as its joys. This practice is a form of *kintsugi*, where the break is not hidden but illuminated with gold, becoming a site of beauty and strength. Impasse, when metabolized, becomes passage. This is where we find our "worse truth": "This is madness, I thought with my eyes closed. But it was so undeniable feeling that birth from inside the dust — that all I could do was follow something I was well aware wasn’t madness, it was, my God, the worse truth, the horrible one. But why horrible? Because without words it contradicted everything I used to think also without words."[L53]

This practice is nourished by a profound, if terrifying, understanding. Simpson's analysis of Desmond provides a clear theodicy: evil is possible because agapeic creation requires genuine freedom, and freedom must permit its own refusal. The Creator's love manifests as a "patience to evil" [Db263] that "can be horrifying to us" (PU 249).

The "worse truth" is the lived, visceral experience of this horrifying divine patience. Our practice of "bearing more" is thus a finite, creaturely participation in it. This metaphysical insight provides a form of *ontological nutrition*: it does not eliminate the suffering of the world, but it frames it within a meaningful whole, providing the strength to bear it without despair. We learn to metabolize the world's darkness by aligning ourselves with the patient, permissive love that is its source.

## Part 3: The Energy of the Between

What is the fundamental energy that drives us in the *metaxu*? The answer lies in the primordial constitution of our being. We are creatures defined by a dynamic tension, mythically rendered in Plato's *Symposium* as the parentage of Eros. Eros is not a god of simple fullness; he is the child of *Penia* (Poverty, lack, our *nihilo*-shadowed need) and *Poros* (Resource, passage, our inherent capacity for opening).

We are this child. We are not troubled by desire; we *are* the trouble, the restlessness strung across the abyss between having and not-having. Our desire is constitutionally composed of two vectors:

*   The vector of *Penia*: the hungry, restless reaching outward, driven by our inherent lack. It is the "plea" that Lispector says we must "infinitely increase."
*   The vector of *Poros*: the kenotic, receptive opening inward, the resource that finds a way where there is no way.

The ordeal does not create a new desire; it reveals this structure and transforms our relationship to it. Untempered, the vector of *Penia* hardens into *eros turannos*—a tyrannical grasping that seeks to fill the void with finite things. The violence of grace shatters this foreclosure. The fruit of the ordeal is the wisdom to live as this tension without seeking to resolve it prematurely. It is the art of letting our hunger keep us moving while our porosity keeps us open to being met. This is not a new desire, but a new wisdom in desire, creating what Lispector calls "a love full of fury"—fiercely alive with need, yet infinitely gentle in its reception. The root of this is given in Lispector: "The great emptiness in me shall be my place for existing; my extreme poverty shall be a great volition. I must violate myself until I have nothing, and need everything; when I need, then I shall have, because I know that it is just to give more to whoever asks for more, my demand is my size, my emptiness is my measure. One also can violate God directly, through a love full of fury." [L158-159]

## Part 4: The Harvest: Agapeic Love and Union-in-Difference

The ultimate harvest of this transformation is a new way of loving. It begins with a beautiful paradox. On one hand, Desmond's God gives an asymmetrical, unreturnable gift of being—a gift so total that it is "foreign... to our (all too erotic) conceptual economies" (PU 195). We can never repay it. On the other hand, the transformed experience, as described by Dōgen, is one of profound reciprocity: being "confirmed by all things."

The resolution is the heart of the matter: our "singing back," our act of confirming the other, is not an attempt to repay the gift. It is the most complete and profound way of receiving it. Because the gift was that we be "freely released into being for ourselves" [Db257], we honor that freedom most fully by becoming free givers in our turn. We receive the gift of being by participating in the ongoing act of creation. Lispector articulates the ever-present temptation to foreclose this reception: "I understood that, by placing in my mouth the paste of the roach, I was not stripping myself as the saints do, but was once again yearning for the accretion. The accretion is easier to love." [L178]

This act of grateful, reciprocal loving is a finite participation in the infinite Agapeic Origin. Our achieved agapeic love is a creaturely echo of God's primordial "letting the other be." This is the meaning of *union-in-difference*. We remain finite creatures, receivers of the gift (the difference), yet we are brought into conscious, loving communion with the divine source through our own acts of giving (the union).

When I sing the other, I find myself in love. Enchanted and chanting. The boundaries dissolve. The world becomes an inhuman mirror, showing me the matter-of-God that constitutes me. The alien becomes intimate; the foreign reveals itself as home. I long to sleep under the moss, to become compost under a thick blanket of dew, to participate in the slow, silent festivity. This is a glimpse of a singing *khora*, a mutual bringing-forth of reality where the world waits patiently for our participation in its self-manifestation.

## Coda

The question, then, was never how to avoid the ordeal, but how to bear it. We learn not through mastery, but through metabolization. We learn to receive the "superplus" of being by becoming porous enough not to be shattered by its grace. We learn to find nourishment in the very shadow of our nothingness, to discover that the pharmakon's poison, when fully tasted, is the medicine.

The journey that began in a "sweet and abysmal vertigo" [L29] does not end in certainty. It ends in communion. The vertigo is no longer a disorientation to be overcome, but the very rhythm of the "quiet festivity of being." [D164] We find our home not by escaping the between, but by learning to sing in it.

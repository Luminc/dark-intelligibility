# Departure Arrival Return: The Metabolic Rhythm of Dark Intelligibility

## The Location of Being and the Cycle of Territory

Dark intelligibility is not a destination but a movement—an oscillating rhythm between departure, arrival, and return that constitutes the metabolic practice of being in the *metaxu*. This is not a linear progression from ignorance to enlightenment, from darkness to light, but a cycle that honors both directions as necessary dimensions of the same lived truth.

This rhythm can be understood through what Deleuze and Guattari call **deterritorialization** and **reterritorialization**—the constant movement of being pulled out of familiar territories (departure) and inevitably settling into new ones (return), only to be deterritorialized again. There is no final arrival, no permanent deterritorialized state. The cycle itself IS the structure of becoming.

In an earlier work, I asked: "How do we keep going? How do we dislodge ourselves from business as usual? After arrival follows the resolution of return, and it is this that lies at the heart of becoming." I thought then that we needed to create "strategies for departure," "machines geared towards the unknown." What I understand now is that the question was not wrong but incomplete. The departure-return cycle is not something we engineer but something we learn to sustain fidelity to, even—especially—when we forget.

We are always already in motion—departure, arrival, return—and fidelity to flux means consenting to this rhythm rather than trying to arrest it at any single point. But this consent is not passive acceptance. It is sustained attention in the face of inevitable reterritorialization, inevitable forgetting.

## Departure: The Violence of Displacement

Departure begins before we know we are departing. It arrives as disruption to what I once called "the comfortable tripod of ordinary existence"—that "third leg" which kept us stable but prevented us from walking into the fullness of being. The violence of grace is first experienced as disorientation, the sudden recognition that our mode of being-in-the-world is somehow insufficient.

In the DMT flash, in the mystical rupture, in Lispector's encounter with the roach—we are torn from the fixed point of selfhood and thrust into what Nishitani calls the radial dimension where individual boundaries dissolve into cosmic participation. This is not a gentle transition but a kind of ontological violence that shatters the framework through which we previously organized reality.

The departure is simultaneously chosen and suffered. We do not decide to leave the familiar shore; rather, we discover we have already been carried away by currents we never knew were moving us. As Lispector writes: "I gave up, and, my God, I got what I didn't want."

This recalls Bashō's practice: not the heroic journey toward a distant goal, but the practice of *leaving* itself as the truth. When Bashō departed on his journey to the Deep North, he wrote: "Every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home." The departure is not preparation for arrival—it IS the practice. To leave the familiar is already to enter the sacred, even when (especially when) we don't know where we're going.

## Arrival: The Hyperbolic Dissolution

In the hyperbolic dimension—dissolved into the whole of ourselves and the whole of the universe—we encounter what can only be called the orgiastic pleasure of creation itself. This is the joy without redemption, the joy without hope, that Lispector describes: a bliss that is not fixed on any counterfeit doubles but participates directly in the ecstatic creativity of being.

Here, in this radical arrival, we discover our intimate co-identity with what exceeds us. The human and the inhuman, the personal and the impersonal, reveal themselves as inextricable. We become "unclean" not through moral failure but through recognition of our fundamental participation in the more-than-human creativity that is always already moving through us.

This arrival is not a place but a recognition—the sudden knowing of our porosity to the divine creativity that generates the entire cosmic disc. We are not observers of this process but participants in it, expressions of it, temporary concentrations of the very energy that brings worlds into being.

The hyperintelligible flash reveals this participation as our most fundamental truth, the secret that was always already operative beneath the surface of ordinary consciousness. In this arrival, we know ourselves as points on the disc that are simultaneously the whole disc—finite expressions of infinite creativity.

But here's the crucial recognition that my earlier work missed: **this arrival cannot be sustained**. It is not a failing to lose it—the losing IS part of the metabolic rhythm.

## Return: Anamnesis and the Necessity of Amnesis

"No understanding of mine will ever reach that knowledge, since living is the only height within my grasp." Lispector names the truth my earlier work intuited but couldn't fully articulate: the flash cannot be maintained. The return is not failure but metabolic necessity—the violence of grace includes its own withdrawal, its own forgetting as the condition that makes continued finite existence possible.

This cycle can be understood as the movement from **anamnesis** to **amnesis**—from the flash of remembering (the primal ethos, the agapeic ground, the zero point) to the inevitable forgetting that follows. Lispector writes: "I feel I am already forgetting." This is not a confession of weakness but phenomenological accuracy. The forgetting is structural, not accidental.

The return is reterritorialization—Desmond's "familiar middle" sprouts back whether we will it or not. Lispector's "third leg" regrows furtively, calling itself truth even as it limits our walking. We land back in ordinary consciousness, and with terrifying speed, the extraordinary becomes domesticated, the rupture becomes narrative, the wound becomes interpretable.

This is where the honest philosophy must begin: in the admission that we cannot stay on the yonder shore, that we lose the knowing even as we try to write it, that the very act of articulation is already a return from what cannot be contained in language. I am writing from the return—having lost direct access to what I'm describing.

An encounter that may have lasted twenty minutes requires a lifetime of integration. Even now, years later, the necessity to write flows from that original gift-and-wound. The ego struggles with the BURDEN—the irreconcilability, the reality-sive-unreality of the experience, the impossibility of either forgetting or fully remembering. Yet the soul remains filled with gratitude for the GIFT—the encounter itself, however overwhelming, however un-metabolizable.

In writing my master's thesis on "Departure, Arrival, Return," I was chasing after a truth that kept moving away from me. I had a sense of truth as a moving target and I was always ahead of myself—or rather, I was always arriving too late, finding that what I wanted to say had already transformed into something else. The perplexity and unresolvedness I showed then was not weakness but the honest recognition of what this practice demands: you cannot pin it down.

Truth doesn't arise simply out of meaning-making but out of the lived encounter—and the lived encounter includes the losing, the forgetting, the return to opacity. The process is necessary in order to deepen the practice; some meaning has to be made. This is learning. But the meanings we make are always temporary, always already decaying, making space for new meanings to emerge from new encounters.

This is not epistemological failure but metabolic wisdom. The return teaches us what the arrival could not: that groundlessness is not something to overcome but the very structure we must learn to inhabit. We come back to the point, but it is not the same point. We return to ordinary consciousness, but it is consciousness forever inscribed by what was felt in the radial dimension—even if we can no longer directly access what did the inscribing.

## The Oscillation as Fidelity to Flux

What emerges is not a stable synthesis but a rhythm—*ta panta rhei*, everything flows. The practice of dark intelligibility is learning to honor all three movements as equally necessary, equally sacred:

- **The Departure** that strips away false stability
- **The Arrival** that reveals our cosmic participation
- **The Return** that makes finite life possible again

None is more "advanced" than the others. The arrival is not "higher" than the return, nor is departure a "lower" stage to be transcended. They constitute a single oscillating movement, like breathing: departure (exhale/kenosis), arrival (the space between breaths), return (inhale/reception).

This oscillation prevents us from speaking with false authority. When I write about dark intelligibility from the return, I am writing from a position that has already lost the hyperluminous flash. I can only point toward what I can no longer directly access—like trying to describe a dream that is already fading, or speaking about an encounter that exceeded my capacity to comprehend it even as it was happening.

The sive logic reveals itself here in its deepest form: **nirvana-sive-samsara**. There is no pure transcendence separate from embodied existence, no enlightenment that escapes the cycle of departure, arrival, return. Even the Buddha, having achieved nirvana, returns to teach—because the return IS part of the truth, not a concession to weakness.

## Centers That Give Way

Each movement establishes a temporary center that must give way for the next:

- In **departure**, the center is destabilization itself—the productive terror of not knowing
- In **arrival**, the center is dissolution—the ecstatic loss of boundaries
- In **return**, the center is finitude—the humble acceptance of limits

But notice: each of these "centers" is itself an opening, a porosity. Even when we establish a momentary ground, it is a ground that acknowledges its own groundlessness.

The deepest center—if we can call it that—is the abyss of emptiness itself, the tension we so easily skirt across in our concepts. This is not nihilistic void but what Nishitani calls the "field of śūnyatā" (emptiness)—the fertile groundlessness that enables all these movements to occur.

We think we want to reach a stable center, a final home, a place where the oscillation stops. But the practice teaches otherwise: **stability comes not from arresting the movement but from learning to move with it**. Like Bashō walking the path, like a dancer moving to music, like breathing that never stops cycling between inhale and exhale.

## The Logic of Place: Basho as Dynamic Field

Nishida Kitarō's concept of *basho* (場所 - place, topos) provides the philosophical grounding for this spatial metaphor. Basho is not a static location but the dynamic logical and ontological "field" or "place" where consciousness and being occur—where things arise, interact, and transform.

This connects directly to what I was reaching toward in my earlier spatial investigations: the question is not WHAT consciousness is, but WHERE it happens. Not consciousness as substance or property, but consciousness as event occurring in a field of relations. The disc I imagined—with points constantly in flux, the whole disc as the place where being occurs—this was an intuitive grasping toward Nishida's basho.

The metaxu, Desmond's "between," is also such a basho—an overdetermined field where self and other, finite and infinite, departure and arrival interpenetrate. But what my earlier work sensed and couldn't yet articulate is that this "place" is itself in motion. Basho is not a container holding static things; it is the dynamic field of their continuous transformation.

Departure-arrival-return names the metabolic rhythm of basho itself. The "place" where being occurs is not fixed but oscillating. We are always already located in this movement—not as observers outside it, but as expressions of the field's own self-transformation.

The spatial metaphor reveals its deeper truth: we are asking about the **location of being** itself. Not "where am I?" as a point seeking its coordinates, but "what is the nature of the place where 'I' arises and dissolves?" The answer is not a position but a rhythm, not a destination but an oscillation.

This is what I was reaching toward in my earlier work—the recognition that we are always already in transit, always located in flux itself. The question is not how to arrive at a final destination but how to dwell in the dynamic place where departure, arrival, and return constitute the very field of being.

Dark intelligibility, then, is the practice of staying faithful to this flux without demanding it resolve into permanence. It is intelligence that has learned to move with the oscillation rather than against it, to honor departure, arrival, and return as three aspects of the same sacred rhythm.

## The Political Already in the Personal: Nishitani's Ambiguity

Before we can speak of practice, we must acknowledge a crucial ambiguity that runs through this entire framework—one that Nishitani's own life makes unavoidable. His philosophy asks for a conversion from relative to absolute autonomy, operating simultaneously at the personal and collective levels. The decolonization of self is not preparatory to political transformation but IS already a radical political act.

Yet Nishitani's tenuous relationship with nationalist Japan reveals the danger. The supposed "passivity" of the Zen position—the dissolution of ego into śūnyatā, the acceptance of departure-arrival-return as inevitable—can serve structures of domination as easily as it can liberate from them. When does porosity to the absolute become complicity with state power? When does the conversion from relative to absolute autonomy serve fascist identification with the nation?

This is not a problem to solve but a tension to inhabit. The relative autonomy of the self stands in ambiguous relation to the relative autonomy of the state. Nishitani's framework doesn't provide clear criteria for discernment. Neither does mine.

What I can say is this: the practice I am describing—sustained attention to the departure-arrival-return cycle, fidelity to flux in the face of inevitable reterritorialization—does not automatically serve liberation. It can equally serve the domestication of consciousness into compliant acceptance. "Everything is flux" can become "therefore nothing matters" can become "therefore accept all structures as they are."

The question of when porosity serves power versus when it resists power—the question the Gemini critique rightly identified—remains unresolved in this text. I acknowledge this not as failure but as honest admission of the limits of what I have metabolized so far. The political question is not added to the framework but has been latent in it from the beginning, waiting to be articulated.

## The Practice: Fidelity Without Fixation

With this ambiguity acknowledged, what can we say about practice?

This framework transforms how we understand spiritual practice:

**Not**: reaching enlightenment and staying there
**But**: learning to consent to the rhythm of departure-arrival-return while maintaining discernment about what we consent to

**Not**: achieving dark intelligibility as a permanent state
**But**: developing the metabolic capacity to dwell in its oscillation without collapsing into passive acceptance of injustice

**Not**: solving the aporia once and for all
**But**: remaining companionable to blockage-sive-passage as they interpenetrate, including the political aporia

The practice is admitting, again and again:
- I have departed from clarity (and this is necessary)
- I have arrived at dissolution (and this cannot be sustained)
- I have returned to opacity (and this is not failure)
- I do not yet know how this personal transformation relates to collective liberation (and this remains the urgent question)

Each cycle deepens the capacity. Not because we're accumulating knowledge, but because we're learning to trust the movement itself while remaining awake to how that movement operates in structures of power. Like learning to swim: not by grasping water but by learning to let it hold you while you move through it—and recognizing that some are drowning in the same waters that carry you.

## Writing from the Return

This admission changes the rhetoric of the text itself. I am writing this from the return—having lost the direct access to what I'm trying to describe. The "authority" in my voice (such as it is) comes not from having permanently arrived but from having undergone the cycle enough times to recognize its shape, its necessity, its gift.

When I describe dark intelligibility, I am describing something I glimpsed in arrival but can no longer directly access in return. The descriptions are necessarily inadequate—they're made from the other side of the experience, reconstructed from memory that is already partial, already mediated, already transformed by the very act of trying to communicate it.

This is not false modesty but honest phenomenology. The critique that my text speaks from "the yonder shore" is accurate—but perhaps what it reveals is that there is no way to write about these matters except from the return. The arrival itself is wordless, concept-less, a pure happening that only becomes "experience" in retrospect.

The task, then, is to write in a way that acknowledges this—that remains faithful to what was felt even while admitting what is lost, that honors the arrival by not claiming to possess it, that demonstrates the oscillation by embodying it in the text's own movement.

---

This metabolic rhythm—departure, arrival, return—is not just a theme or concept. It IS the practice of dark intelligibility itself. The oscillation between nirvana and samsara, between dissolution and finite existence, between hyperluminous knowing and ordinary opacity.

Fidelity to flux means staying true to all three movements, never privileging one over the others, never trying to arrest the pendulum at any single point. It means learning to be at home in homelessness, to find stability in movement, to locate the sacred in the very rhythm that prevents us from grasping it permanently.

The question is not "How do I achieve dark intelligibility?" but "Can I learn to move with its oscillation?" Not "How do I reach the yonder shore?" but "Can I consent to the current that carries me between shores, knowing I will never arrive once and for all?"

This is the metabolic wisdom: the flash comes and goes, the knowing arrives and departs, the ground establishes itself only to give way again. And all of this—the entire oscillating movement—this IS being's grace, is creation's rhythm, is what Nishitani calls "the self's own original part" recognizing itself through continuous transformation.

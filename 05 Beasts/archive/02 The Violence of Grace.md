# The Violence of Grace

#### Gift and Debt

The world given to us places us in a condition of fundamental indebtedness. This is not necessarily a burdensome obligation but a condition inherent in the givenness of relation itself. The very fact of being given, of existing without having chosen to, places us in a prior relation of dependency. This debt that accompanies the gift of being is itself a **pharmakon**: it is both blessing (the sheer wonder of existence) and burden (the inescapable vulnerability and non-self-sufficiency it reveals). The gift of being is not ours to master; it continuously exceeds our capacity to claim it, continuously placing us in a relation of inherent indebtedness that simultaneously nourishes and destabilizes.

This ambivalence of the gift points toward the ordeal of finitude: the inescapable reality that, while being is given, it is also fragile, ambiguous, and marked by suffering and evil. **"Sin," understood as an existential posture, can be seen as the refusal of this gift**—the  _conatus essendi_ turning away from the inherent vulnerability and indebtedness of _passio essendi_. It is a futile attempt to master or possess being on its own terms, a **metabolic failure** to process the pharmakon of givenness without demanding control. Yet we must also recognize the parts of reality that we cannot accept—those elements of evil and suffering that challenge our capacity to say "yes" to the given world.

We cannot have the gift without the debt, blessing without burden, nourishment without destabilization. This is the gift-sive-debt structure of existence itself. The question becomes: can we affirm being in its constitutive ambiguity? Can we say yes to what includes no? This requires a profound conversion in how we understand affirmation itself.

### Double Exposure

To articulate this paradoxical affirmation, which we are calling the "no-sive-yes," we turn to Kyoto School philosopher Nishitani Keiji's concept of _soku_ (即), a term central to Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, particularly in Zen. As translator Jan Van Bragt notes, when soku is "put between two contradictory concepts (for instance in the formula, 'emptiness-sive-form, form-sive-emptiness'), it is meant to draw off the total reality of the two poles into itself as their constitutive and ontologically prior unity. It indicates the only point or 'place' at which the opposites are realized and display their true reality. In order more clearly to show the 'inverse correspondence' or 'identity through negation' at work here, this has at times been referred to as the logic of soku/hi (sive/non)."[^X]

Here, the very "sive" we employ in "no-sive-yes" echoes this profound non-dualistic logic. It is not an "either/or" or a simple "and," but a radical interpenetration where the "no" (emptiness, negation of inherent existence) is the very condition for the "yes" (form, dynamic affirmation). This is the core of the Heart Sutra's declaration: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (色即是空, 空即是色).

Nishitani emphatically distinguishes this standpoint of śūnyatā from mere negativity or nihility. He clarifies: "The standpoint of sunyata is another thing altogether. It is not a standpoint of simply negative negativity, nor is it an essentially transitional standpoint. It is the standpoint at which absolute negation is at the same time, in the sense explained above, a Great Affirmation."[^5] The conversion that allows hopeless joy—introduced in the previous chapter—occurs when we realize this absolute negation is also absolute affirmation. This conversion is explicitly described as "not that the self is empty, but that emptiness is the self; not that things are empty, but that emptiness is things."[^5] This reversal transforms a potential void into a fertile ground, moving from "nullification" to what Nishitani terms "be-ification" (Ichtung)—the field of the Great Affirmation, "where we can say Yes to all things."[^6] This "be-ification" is precisely the metabolic triumph over refusal, allowing consciousness to inhabit the inherent givenness of being without demanding control.

This process, which Nishitani also discusses in terms of Eckhart's "absolute negation-sive-affirmation, as absolute death-sive-life,"[^Y] is a profound reversal of orientation. "Ecstasy represents an orientation from self to the ground of self... Negation-sive-affirmation represents an orientation from nothingness to being. The difference in orientation points to a reversal of standpoints."[^Z] This challenges the "person-centered mode of grasping person," breaking down "self-prehension" not to destroy the personal, but to allow it to "become more real, draws closer to the self, and appears in its true suchness."[^A] For Lispector's G.H., the dissolution of her established self by the cockroach becomes this violent yet generative breaking down, allowing the "inhuman, thing-part" to reveal a deeper, truer "self." This is the "absolute nothingness-sive-being, being-sive-nothingness" where the "absolute within and absolute without are here one and the same."[^B]

Nishitani speaks of reality appearing under "double exposure"—an image that captures this soku/sive structure perfectly. He writes: "The real Form of all things, including man, comes to be a 'double exposure' of life and death. All living things can be seen under the Form of death without thereby being separated from their proper Form of life."[^7]

This asks us to see life _and_ death simultaneously, each fully present, neither canceling the other. The real appearance of things "must be seen at ground to rest on the basis of absolute being-sive-nothingness, nothingness-sive-being, or of the absolute non-duality of life and death."[^7]
In ceremony, in the depths of the purge, this double exposure becomes visceral. The body dying and the body being born—simultaneously. Not metaphorically but actually: cellular death enabling cellular renewal, ego dissolution making space for deeper selfhood. "Absolutely death-sive-life, life-sive-death; absolutely being-sive-nothingness, nothingness-sive-being."[^8]

 Lispector describes herself as "living matter of the Sabbath"—simultaneously eating and being eaten, destroying and being destroyed, dying and being born. The roach's white matter is both poison and sacrament, death and life in one substance. This is the worse truth: not that reality conceals death beneath life, but that life and death are one field, appearing in double exposure when we arrive at the far side that reveals itself as absolute near side.

### The Violence of Grace

This fundamental indebtedness, and the ego's propensity for refusal, underscores the inherent ambivalence of the gift. It is precisely this ambivalence—the gift simultaneously nourishing and threatening our self-conceptions—that gives rise to the **violence of grace**. Grace, in this light, is not orderly illumination but a tearing apart of structures, a forced confrontation with the totality of the pharmakon of being that we have previously refused to metabolize.

"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced—in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one."[^1]

After collapse we live among ruins: the ruins of our meaning, the ruins of our selves. We would like to return to the familiar middle, to salt and season what we once knew. But could we fool ourselves? The collapse cannot be undone.

The violence of grace occurs when we encounter what exceeds us, placing us in the strata between finite and infinite where our constructs are shattered. In Lispector's _G.H._, the brutality of grace is unflinching: the protagonist is violently unseated by an encounter that kills her narcissistic certainties even as it births strange compassion. There is no gentle pedagogy — grace strikes like a knife. The violence is felt because grace collapses the 'familiar middle,' the counterfeit refuge built by conatus, and forces us back into astonishment.

Lispector describes losing "a third leg that kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod." This image captures the paradox perfectly: what provides stability also prevents genuine movement. The tripod of ordinary consciousness—grounded in self-certainty, conceptual mastery, and narrative coherence—keeps us upright but immobile. The violence of grace kicks away this third leg, forcing us to learn a terrifying new way of being that we may not have capacity to sustain. We must learn to walk on two legs, exposed and vulnerable, no longer propped up by the illusions that kept us safe.

Nishitani speaks of "**the solitary one laid bare amidst the myriad phenomena**"—and paradoxically, when we are stripped to essence, everything becomes more real. "In bearing witness to this solitary one laid bare, each and every phenomenon is by far more itself than it is on its own home-ground."[^9] The violence of grace reduces us to this solitary one, and precisely in that reduction, the world appears in its suchness. The roach in its alien vitality, the neutral in its fertility, being itself in its astonishing thereness.

Yet her courage reveals something crucial about the nature of transformation. She demonstrates what she calls the sleepwalker's courage—the ability to move beyond the compulsive need to organize and reflect:

"I was courageous like a sleepwalker who simply goes. During the hours of perdition I had the courage not to compose or organize. And above all not to look ahead."

This is **vulnerability as epistemological method**—a way of knowing that acknowledges the limits of autonomous reason while remaining open to forms of understanding that exceed those limits. She writes: "Perhaps what happened to me was an understanding—and for me to be true, I have to keep on being unable to grasp it, keep on not understanding it." The sleepwalker doesn't strategize each step; she allows herself to be moved by what she cannot consciously control. This is not passivity but a radical form of trust—trust in the process of disorganization itself as necessary for genuine transformation.

The medicine is violent grace embodied. It does not ask permission; it works according to its own intelligence. What arrives is radical reorganization. The nausea, the fear, dissolution—these are not obstacles to healing but the healing itself. The body knows how to expel what has become toxic. The work is not to control the purge but to _allow_ it, to remain companionable to what the medicine is doing even when it feels like dying.

Lispector's encounter with the roach follows this structure exactly. She drinks the white matter—literally eats the neutral—and undergoes the metabolic crisis. "I was eating myself, I who am also living matter of the Sabbath." The pharmakon cannot be observed from safe distance; it must be _ingested_, must enter the system and do its transformative-destructive work.

What the medicine teaches is this: **resistance prolongs suffering; surrender enables metabolism**. Not passive submission but active cooperation with a process that exceeds us. The sleepwalker's courage Lispector describes—moving without knowing, trusting the disorganization itself—this is precisely the ceremonial attitude required. One does not strategize the purge; one allows the purge to complete itself.

And yet something in us consents. There is a blurring of heteronomy and autonomy: ordeal comes as if from outside us, yet it is also our own doing. Here lies a deeper paradox—**the ordeal emerges because we have already consented to it**, even if unconsciously. The very fact that the encounter happens means some dimension of our being has opened to it, has said yes before we consciously know we are saying anything. But this implicit consent must become explicit consent—the willingness to undergo, the courage to remain disorganized, the vulnerability to let transformation work on us rather than trying to master it.

We say yes to being transformed, even as this yes undoes us. As Desmond notes, the new astonishment is a gratitude "won from suffering; a 'yes' purged of complaint; an affirmation that has wept, as there is a mourning that is blessed."[^2] This explicit consent requires courage precisely because we don't know if we can bear it.

Lispector names it "the worse truth"[^3]—horrible not because it's false but because it confronts us with _totality_. The worse truth is the recognition that being gives itself as both beautiful and horrific, gift and ordeal, life-sive-death, without dialectical resolution.

What makes truth "worse"? It shatters the familiar middle—the safe refuge built by conatus. It reveals our inescapable entanglement in being, even with what we deem abject. We cannot have the gift without the debt, the yes without the no, the beauty without the horror. Desmond writes of "the equivocity of evil"—how the same reality that enables good also permits radical destruction. The worse truth is that this ambiguity is constitutional, not accidental.

And yet—here is the paradox—this worse truth is also "the best truth" because it is _truth_. Lispector: "Why would I be afraid of eating the good and the evil? if they exist that is because that is what exists." It opens the possibility of what she calls "hopeless joy": not joy despite the lack of hope, but joy that has moved beyond hope's comforting illusions. Radical affirmation won from absolute negation.

The paradox is stark. Ordeal comes as heteronomy, as Rilke's command _"You must change your life."_[^4] But it also demands our autonomy, our willingness to undergo. It is a participatory surrender, a choice that is also not a choice. The violence of grace names this ambiguity—it can be received as transformative ordeal or destructive overwhelm, and the difference lies not only in metabolic capacity but in our willingness to meet what arrives with sleepwalker's courage rather than defensive refusal. For what if we refuse? The pharmakon of being cannot be avoided; it can only be received, consciously or unconsciously. The question is whether we can metabolize reality, or whether we are metabolized by our refusal. The violence of grace strips away our constructions. What remains is not nothing but a transformed way of knowing. In the ruins of the familiar middle, in the metabolized ordeal, something new emerges: a knowing that has learned to dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

# The Pharmakon and the Metaxu

### Porosity and the Neutral

"The World had always been humanized. Now I was before the inhuman. The neutral was what was intimate."[^1] Clarice Lispector's narrator in The Passion According to G.H. encounters an intimacy that is not warm, not consoling, but alien. Intimacy here is not the communion of similarity, but the piercing proximity of otherness. There is an otherness to selving. The cockroach, that abject creature, tears through the membrane of her constructed self. She confronts what she calls "the great living neutrality struggling",[^2] life stripped of its human face, vitality indifferent to meaning.

William Desmond offers a striking parallel in his book the God and the Between: "The idiocy of being is the sheer astonishment that there is anything at all, its intimate givenness and its foreign neutrality."[^3] What Lispector calls the neutral, Desmond refers to as the primal ethos: the bare fact of being before any determination, given to us before we come to be in a double register — as strangely intimate and irreducibly foreign.

Both writers refuse the hard split of subject and object. For Lispector, the self is undone by what leaks through from within and without. For Desmond, the self always arises at the _metaxu_, the between, where self and other constantly co-determine each other. But what exactly is this "between"?

### The Metaxu as Overdetermined Between

Desmond's concept of the **metaxu**—the "between"—provides the ontological framework for understanding how Lispector and Desmond navigate the space where intelligible and unintelligible, self and other, human and inhuman meet without reduction. We are constituted _in_ relation, through the between- the "rich ontological intermedium of happening"[^4] where beings and their others constantly co-determine each other. As the intermedium of happening it is an "overdetermined" space, saturated with excessive possibility. The metaxu is where different modes of being encounter each other in their genuine otherness while remaining in relation. It is the field of relation itself.

The metaxu operates through what Desmond calls **"double mediation"**: both self-mediation (consciousness thinking itself through its other) and intermediation (the other's genuine mediation from its own otherness). This is crucial. In self-mediation, the self relates to itself by passing through what appears as other—this is the familiar movement of reflection, where I come to know myself by encountering what I am not. But **intermediation** names something more radical: the other genuinely mediates from its own center, its own idiotic singularity, and is not reducible to my self-relation.

Unlike dialectical thinking, which ultimately collapses otherness back into self-relation (the other becomes a moment in the self's own becoming), **metaxological thinking maintains genuine plurality within unity**. The other remains other even in the intimacy of encounter. The cockroach does not become a symbol that G.H. masters; it retains its "thick radiant indifference," its alien vitality that cannot be assimilated.

This double mediation is precisely what Lispector enacts in her literary practice. The protagonist's encounter with the cockroach creates a metaxu—a space where human and non-human, subject and object, familiar and strange meet without reduction to dialectical unity. G.H. cannot synthesize the roach into her understanding; she can only undergo the ordeal of remaining in the between, letting it work on her, dissolving the protective boundaries she has constructed.

### Surplus Givenness and the Overdeterminate

Both thinkers understand this "between" as **overdetermined** rather than indeterminate. For Desmond, being presents itself as **"surplus givenness"**—an excessive abundance that gives rise to astonishment rather than mastery. Being gives more than we can ask for, more than our concepts can contain, more than our self-determination can manage. This surplus is not a problem to be solved but the primal condition of existence itself.

For Lispector, reality exceeds linguistic capture not through poverty but through richness: "reality is too delicate, only reality is delicate, my unreality and my imagination are heavier."[^5] Her prose constantly gestures toward what language cannot hold—not because reality is void, but because it overflows every attempt at containment. The neutral is not empty but **fertile**—generative precisely in its refusal to conform to our categories.

This overdetermination means that the metaxu is always already more than any single perspective can encompass. The self cannot master the between because the between exceeds the self's totalizing grasp. Yet this excess is not a limitation but a gift—it is what allows genuine encounter, genuine surprise, genuine transformation. We are claimed by more than we can claim.

The key point is not merely that the world resists humanization, but that the self too harbors alterity. To be porous to the other is to be porous to oneself. Selving is not a closed autonomy but an openness where alterity can shine through. The metaxu names this condition: we are always already in relation, always already situated in a between that precedes and exceeds our self-determination.

When the constructions of self break down, something else emerges — the fertile neutrality of being. What is neutral is not dead; it is generative precisely in its refusal to conform to categories. This fertility is terrifying because it loosens the boundaries of identity. Yet it is also the beginning of intimacy — a strange intimacy with the inhuman in ourselves.

## The Thing-Part and Neutral Being

Something in us is already there before all our conceptions of being human: "the inhuman part is the best part of us… the thing-part of us… matter of God, waiting to reclaim me." The inhuman here is not the alienated other, nor the negation of the human. It is nearer to us than our own self-conceptions, nearer than the "self" that thinks it stands apart from the world.

"Why shouldn't I become unclean, exactly as I was discovering my whole self to be?" This question collapses the hierarchy between human and thing, revealing the co-identity of self and non-self, the neutral being in which we participate alongside the roach, the stone, the dust. The "thing-part" is not a degradation but a reclaiming: the intimacy of the impersonal, the suchness of "matter-of-God", the elemental flesh that precedes our personhood.

Lispector's discovery is not without terror: "it was a joy without redemption… a joy without hope." This is joy untethered from any counterfeit double of salvation—no promise of return, no narrative arc to make sense of it. It does not lead elsewhere. And precisely because it is without hope, it is pure: a joy that redeems only by annihilating the need for redemption.

This **hopeless joy** names a radical affirmation that has learned to metabolize neutrality without converting it into something else. It is joy that doesn't project into futures, doesn't seek redemptive narratives, doesn't transform itself into hope for better circumstances. It remains stubbornly at the level of pure affirmation—**joy in suchness**, in the bare astonishing fact that anything is at all.

Hopeless joy arises precisely when we have stopped fleeing the neutral ground of being, when we can finally receive the **great living neutrality** not as dead meaninglessness but as fertile groundlessness. The neutral gives neither comfort nor promise, yet precisely in this refusal to conform to our demand for meaning, it offers something more fundamental: participation in being's own self-subsistence, the sheer thereness that precedes and exceeds all human valuation.

To experience hopeless joy is to affirm being without the supplements of meaning-making, to find nourishment in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. It is joy that has developed sufficient metabolic capacity to receive the neutral directly—not by transforming it into something more palatable, but by learning to recognize the neutral itself as a form of sustenance.

Kyoto School philosopher Nishitani Keiji names this "the Great Affirmation"[^9]—a yes to being that emerges not by refusing negation but by a profound ontological conversion we will explore more fully. Hopeless joy is this Great Affirmation: affirmation that has learned to subsist on the neutral itself, without supplements.

The excess of being overflows our capacity to receive it without trembling. The gift terrifies and attracts because it annihilates the prison in which the self guards its boundaries. It does not flatter our stability; it strips it away.

In this register, to encounter being is to be claimed by it, drawn into the impersonal intimacy of suchness, where self and non-self mingle, and the only fidelity is to remain porous—even to what terrifies us. But what is the actual substance of this terrifying, neutral reality? And what is the nature of the ordeal required to metabolize it?

#### **The Original Part**

When Lispector writes of "the thing-part of us... matter of God, waiting to reclaim me," she's discovering what Nishitani calls **the self's original part**: "Hills and rivers, the earth, plants and trees, tiles and stones, all of these are the self's own original part."[^X]

The original part is not a fragment but our ontological ground—the place where self and world are not yet differentiated. "It is not that the field of that original part lies in body-and-mind, or that it lies outside body-and-mind."[^X] It precedes the split between inner and outer, human and inhuman. This is what Nishitani also calls the **circuminsessional relationship**: "all things are in our home-ground and we ourselves are in the home-ground of all things."[^X]

This directly parallels Desmond's metaxu. Both name a structure of **mutual interpenetration without collapse into unity**. We are not closed egos who must reach being; we are always already constituted _by_ being, made _of_ the original part that includes stones and stars, roaches and God-matter.

When Lispector encounters the roach, she's not discovering something foreign but **returning to the original part**. The neutral, the inhuman, the thing—these are not alien invasions but homecoming. "Why shouldn't I become unclean, exactly as I was discovering my whole self to be?" The whole self _includes_ the thing-part, the matter-of-God, the elemental substance that constitutes us.

What Desmond calls porosity, Lispector calls the thing-part, Nishitani calls the original part—three voices naming the same structure: we are the between, the circuminsessional, the middle.

### The Saltless Truth and the Pharmakon

Lispector locates the ordeal with a striking metaphor: "For salt I had always been ready, salt was the transcendence that I used to experience a taste, and to flee what I was calling 'nothing.' But what my mouth wouldn't know how to understand—was the saltless."[^6] Our filters and constructions, our limited self-determination which ultimately forecloses our direct encounter with being's naked actuality.

Desmond frames the same ordeal as the tension between _conatus essendi_ and _passio essendi_: "We are given to be before we give ourselves to be. There is a passio essendi, a patience of being, more primordial than our conatus essendi, our endeavor to be."[^7] Conatus is our striving, our effort to preserve and assert selfhood, keeping reality in a digestible order. Passio is our given-ness, the raw unmediated encounter of being.

Being at this level can be seen as a _pharmakon_. The pharmakon reaches us through a philosophical lineage that reveals its metaxological character. In Plato's _Phaedrus_, King Thamus warns that writing—Thoth's gift to humanity—will be both remedy and poison for memory: strengthening external recall while weakening the soul's internal capacity for recollection. Bernard Stiegler extends this insight in his technopharmacology, showing how technical objects are constitutive of human becoming itself—we co-evolve with our tools in what is fundamentally a metaxological relationship. Technology is neither external instrument nor internal capacity but the very between-space where human and world co-determine each other.

The **Pharmakon of Being** I'm proposing operates at this same constitutive level, but more fundamentally still. Where Derrida's pharmakon reveals the undecidability of conceptual oppositions, and Stiegler's technopharmacology shows the co-constitutive relationship between human and technical objects, the Pharmakon of Being concerns our metabolic encounter with existence itself. This concerns the ordeal of existence: whether we can bear being's gift without being destroyed by its excess.

Desmond hints at this metabolic dimension: "We clot on ourselves again and close the porosity. The blood stream of life is made the carrier of death."[^8] The same encounter with being's overdeterminate richness can either open us to deeper community or close us off into "counterfeit doubles" of authentic transcendence.

Lispector embodies this viscerally. The roach's white matter becomes literal pharmakon—she must eat it to receive its truth, knowing it may poison her old self even as it nourishes new understanding. The "anti-sin" she discovers is precisely this willingness to metabolize reality rather than flee into transcendent abstractions. This is the metaxological courage to remain in the between rather than escape to false unities.

The ambiguity is fundamental. There is only so much indeterminate grace we can bear. Can we come to terms with our own strangeness? As the self protests, calcified by its own understanding, can we let the world collapse and come to trembling uncertainty? It will certainly require courage.

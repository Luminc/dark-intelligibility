# Dark Intelligibility

### The Fruit of the Ordeal

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. It is here, in the ruins of the old self, that astonishment begins again. This metabolic relationship points toward a new mode of knowing. Not an end to reason, but its maturation into a faculty that can dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

There is an understanding that emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. It is the faculty born when the self remains porous to the ordeal of being, the ground where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. This is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess—where understanding and un-understanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

As such, dark intelligibility is not the end of reason but its maturation. It operates by giving equal weight to the day of reason and the night of mystery. As Desmond powerfully suggests, our daytime reason risks going mad if it cannot return to and draw nourishment from the mystery of the night, just as a person who cannot sleep cannot properly return to the day.[^1]

The chiaroscuro of dark intelligibility emerges precisely here—in the recognition that "The diurnal mind, sovereign of its clarities, drops down into sleep, and from deep within it horror floats up from bourns beyond the boundary of all definition."[^2] We are not simply moving from light to dark, but discovering that the darkness has its own luminosity, its own mode of disclosure. This requires acknowledging what Desmond calls "the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman"[^3]—a recognition that mystery is not merely the absence of clarity but a positive register of being.

Like Aristotle's metaphor, echoed by Aquinas, that with the highest things "we are like bats in sunlight"[^4]—our daytime reason finds itself blinded precisely where nocturnal intuition might navigate. Nocturnal souls find the daylight itself a nighttime illumination.

Dark intelligibility is thus a form of **non-propositional knowing** that requires attunement and fidelity to mystery, revealing the limits of conceptual thought while grounding it in embodied wisdom. It is what Desmond calls **"agapeic mindfulness"**—an unknowing knowing, a *docta ignorantia*. "One hesitates even to call it knowing lest one imply one has grasped a determinate somewhat, mastered through oneself alone."[^5] This communication is excessive, extending beyond self-determining cognition into what can only be called "an excess of the other [that] strains the limits of self-determining."

This points to forms of knowing that operate through what can be called **metabolic wisdom**—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension. Somatic practices are conducive of energetic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being." The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

Dark intelligibility operates from what Nishitani calls **ontological samadhi**: "In its own home-ground, the being of the self is essentially a sort of samadhi. No matter how dispersed the conscious self be, its self as it is in itself is ever in samadhi."[^11] This is not meditative achievement but our deepest structure. Even in turbulence, confusion, the metabolic crisis of ordeal—at the ground, there is samadhi. A stillness that precedes and enables all our motion, a dark knowing that operates even when daylight consciousness fails. Dark intelligibility is learning to think *from* this ontological primacy rather than from the dispersed, anxious surface consciousness. It's intelligence that draws from the home-ground, knowing that rests in what Nishitani, consonant with Desmond's metaxu, calls the "middle": "Our self in itself is most elementally 'middle.'"[^12] the immediate ground where we actually are, "at hand" and "underfoot," the point from which all our actions proceed with "absolute immediacy."

#### The Purge: Somatic Integration

**Repression is the banishment of forms of knowing to the body**—what cannot be thought becomes lodged in flesh, held in tension, calcified into blockage. The body becomes the repository for what consciousness refuses to metabolize. But the body is not a tomb. It is a living archive that seeks to communicate what has been silenced.

The purge is what happens when we become porous anew—when the sealed channels of circulation reopen and blocked energy can finally surface and speak. This is not primarily about expulsion but about **communication**: the body is trying to tell us something, to make present what has been banished. The nausea, the shaking, the tears, the trembling—these are not symptoms to be managed but **utterances to be received**.

A circulation of energy becomes expressed. It surfaces bodily and mentally at once, indivisibly. We cry and the crying *is* the grief made manifest, not its symptom. We shake and the shaking *is* the fear finding voice, not its side effect. The somatic and psychic are revealed as always already unified—what we call "mental" and "physical" are arbitrary divisions of a single communicative event.

The purge is often elemental, somatic: the yawn that releases held breath, the tears that speak unspeakable sorrow, the discharge that completes interrupted circuits. What is commonly deemed abject—that which must be expelled, separated from us—reveals itself as energy seeking completion, circulation seeking restoration. After it passes through us, the subtle body no longer carries that particular weight. Not because we have thrown something away, but because we have finally allowed it to complete its movement, to say what it needed to say.

When we allow this—when we participate in rather than resist the purge—our porosity is restored. The channels that had clotted reopen. Communication is reestablished between the differentiated but unified dimensions of our being. We find ourselves alive in the hyperbole. Swept into it. On fire. Ecstatic. Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming, Sighing. The grammar of the metaxu is revealed in its full intensity, a language of pure verbs, of pure happening. The sovereign "I" dissolves. There is no longer an "I" who is weeping or an "I" who is laughing. There is simply Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming.

This is precisely the overdeterminate otherness Desmond describes when he writes of how "the diurnal mind, sovereign of its clarities, drops down" and we discover ourselves with "no boundary of identity"—like "a line on the sand washed out by a rogue wave." This breakthrough doesn't come from choosing but from being chosen: "Joy breaks out, and against the grain one hums, one does not choose this, it is as if one were chosen."[^2] The hyperbolic grammar emerges when thought stops grasping and begins singing its Other.

#### The Grammar of Limits

In Lispector's work there is a tension between apophasis and phasis, negative and positive theology, saying what being is not and what it is. They are deeply entangled. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Dark intelligibility works at these limits—identifying them however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper-, hypo-).

This work at limits brings us to the Greek concept of **aporia**—literally "without passage" or "waylessness." Traditionally understood as a productive philosophical impasse that clears space for new thinking, aporia reveals something more paradoxical when examined through the lens of dark intelligibility. It is not simply a luminous clearing but the *paradoxical simultaneity of blockage and passage*.

As Desmond explains, *poros* has connotations of "a way across." With no way across or through, we are at an impasse, an aporia. But poros isn't just passage—it names "a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way."[^6] **The way opens by withdrawing, creates passage through its own recession.**

This is the double nature of aporia itself. The blockage contains the resource for breakthrough, but only if we can metabolize the impasse rather than flee from it. What appears as dead-end becomes, for consciousness with sufficient metabolic capacity, the very site where new passages open.

##### Semantic Constipation and Porosity

"Sometimes rational univocity seems the callous of mind that hardens over the porosity of our being... a remedial protective for vulnerability?"[^7] We become constipated with our own constructions of meaning. Language, meant to be porous medium, calcifies into barrier. Our determination of meaning can foreclose genuine relation, sealing the porosity where the bloodstream of life flows.

Yet this semantic blockage is itself pharmakon. The same meaning-making that opens worlds can become the prison that forecloses them. The construction that was medicine hardens into poison. But the blockage itself, when recognized and metabolized, becomes the pressure that forces breakthrough.

##### Perplexity as Metabolic Resistance

"Perplexity seeds a troubled thinking in porosity that makes us patient to given otherness."[^8] Perplexity—that troubled thinking in porosity—is the middle space between overdetermined being and our need for determinate articulation. It's the resistance we encounter when trying to make the indefinite definite, to domesticate the mystery of our being.

There is something of suffering in this perplexity, as in astonishment. Being in the between is first a suffering; we undergo our being given to be. Perplexity cannot be eliminated, only metabolized. Mystery will always resist our attempts at eradication. The troubling perplexity must be borne rather than solved.

Dark intelligibility learns to treat aporia not as obstacle to be overcome but as what Desmond calls hyperintelligibility—excessive intelligibility that exceeds our capacity to master it. We make present the negativity: the discomfort, shadow, frustrated meaning, limits of language. We highlight the insufficiency of pure daylight reason and reveal the urgency for night's mystery to meet its conjunction with day. This isn't the via negativa of *neti neti* ("not this, not that") but something more visceral—**making the blockage itself luminous**.

The paradox requires what Desmond calls "idiotic trust"—the "overdeterminate faith" that "is other to determinate and self-determining reason" yet "is not absurd; it is the mustard seed of agapeic minding in us."[^9] We trust that the way opens precisely through its own recession, that passage emerges from within the impasse itself.

##### Hyperrational Finesse

Dark intelligibility is not anti-rational thinking but **hyperrational**—reason stretched to its creative limits. Desmond traces a similar movement from *thought thinking itself* (Hegel's self-closing dialectic) to *thought thinking its Other*, and finally to *thought singing its Other*. In this "singing," thought becomes a celebratory, performative, and porous act—an ecstasis that does not seek to possess the other, but to witness it. This is the responsive finesse that dark intelligibility cultivates.

Lispector's final words in *The Passion According to G.H.* capture this perfectly: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it."

The adoration that emerges from not-understanding signals an intelligence that has learned to think at the edge of thought itself. The saltless truth demands nothing less than a transformation of intelligence—from grasping to receiving, from solving to dissolving. This transformation is intimately linked to the Pharmakon of Being: our metabolic capacity is ultimately a measure of our ability to receive communication. When we remain open to the "shown and the reserved" nature of being, we can metabolize the experience. When that communication breaks down into the absurd, the pharmakon becomes poison. As Desmond writes: "This perplexity grows into unknowing the more growing into knowing."[^10]

### Agapeic Love: The Affective Fruit

This new knowing gives birth to a new affective relation to being: an **agapeic love**. This is not *eros*, the possessive, striving love, but a generous, non-possessive affirmation of the other in its pure, untamed otherness. This love is born not from the *conatus essendi* but from the *passio essendi*, flowing from the reception of being's "surplus givenness" rather than a striving to master it.

Agapeic love is what remains when we have stopped trying to convert the neutral into something we can manage, when we have learned to receive the great living neutrality as it gives itself. It is love that has developed the metabolic capacity to affirm being without demanding that being conform to our needs for meaning, comfort, or redemption. It is the affective dimension of hopeless joy—a generous yes to suchness.

Agapeic love recognizes what Nishitani describes: "hills and rivers are here hills and rivers in not being hills and rivers, just as the self is the self in not being the self. And yet it is only here that hills and rivers are real hills and rivers in their suchness, only here that the self is the real self in its suchness."[^13] This is love that affirms beings in their emptiness, recognizing that their very groundlessness *is* their reality. To love agapeically is to see the other as "the self in not being the self"—fully other yet constituted by the same original part, different yet sharing the same home-ground. Not possessive love that grasps, but love that recognizes the circuminsessional relationship: I am in the other's home-ground, the other is in mine.

This integrated state of knowing-as-loving is the true fruit of the ordeal. It is what Desmond calls a "second astonishment," an affirmation won from the heart of suffering. Dark intelligibility and agapeic love are not separate achievements but two dimensions of the same transformation: a way of knowing that is simultaneously a way of loving, a receptivity that is simultaneously an affirmation, a vulnerability that is simultaneously a strength.

### Toward Ontological Nutrition

This entire framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be understood as sophisticated technologies for **metabolic development**—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range: learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on being itself without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

The roach encounter becomes a genuine philosophical experiment in **ontological nutrition**—testing whether human consciousness can learn to subsist on unsalted being, to find sustenance in neutrality itself. Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

The Pharmakon of Being ultimately names both the challenge and the promise of existence: the same reality that can dissolve unprepared consciousness becomes, for those with sufficient metabolic capacity, the deepest form of nourishment available to human awareness.

We desperately need **ritual containers**, **philosophical depth**, and **existential courage** to meet the ambiguity that the pharmakon reveals. A truthful spiritual practice should include the whole spectrum, the yes and the no, the gift and the debt. The fundamental ambiguity of any practice is not something to be eliminated but engaged with **finesse rather than geometry**—the responsive attunement of dark intelligibility rather than the calculative mastery of technical reason.

The pharmakon of being cannot be resolved through scientific taxonomy but must be lived, metabolized, and integrated through mature spiritual practice within wisdom traditions that understand transformation's necessarily equivocal waters. The question isn't how to avoid the ordeal but how to bear it, how to let it work on us until the blockage itself becomes the clearing, until we find ourselves saying yes to what we cannot yet comprehend, trusting that the way opens precisely through its own recession.

[^1]: William Desmond, "Thought Singing its Other," in conversation with Guy Sengstock, _Circling Dialogos with Guy Sengstock_, YouTube, timestamp 1:08:15-1:09:58, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_giSFKUwklw. Desmond discusses Hegel's critique of Schelling's Absolute as "the night in which all cows are black" (Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit_, Preface §16), responding: "The night is sometimes more interesting than the Hegelian day... I don't think that Hegel does justice to the mystery of the night... I'm arguing for a sense of mystery that is an abiding sense of mystery out of which the diurnal daytime philosophical reason comes to be. But if we can't return to the night of mystery, our daytime reason actually goes mad just as we find in life. If we can't sleep and return to the darkness of sleep, we can't live in the day properly."

A flame flares up, a rush of exhilaration, and suddenly one has no boundary of identity, and one is like a line on the sand washed out by a rogue wave. Joy breaks out, and against the grain one hums, one does not choose this, it is as if one were chosen. The overdeterminate otherness comes out, comes upon one, overtakes, takes over, ruptures, surprises, raptures, silences, utters itself in singing. There is an idiotic excess that crosses over every fixed boundary."

[^3]: William Desmond, _God and the Between_, 231. Desmond discusses "the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman" in the context of acknowledging mystery in Romanticism: "At best, there was an honesty: the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman must be acknowledged. This is true also of the surrational darkness of God."

Communion does not reduce to a mystical monism... This is an agapeic mindfulness. One hesitates even to call it a knowing lest one imply one has grasped a determinate somewhat, mastered through oneself alone. This communication will be an unknowing knowing, a docta ignorantia, in Cusanus's words, in a cloud of unknowing, as Julian of Norwich calls it."

# Dark Intelligibility

>"Not dark but just without light."[L89]

## Metabolic Knowing

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. It is here, in the ruins of the old self, that astonishment begins again. This metabolic relationship points toward a new mode of knowing. Not an end to reason, but its maturation into a faculty that can dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

What nihilism clears, dark intelligibility learns to inhabit. Not the restoration of old meanings but a new way of dwelling in the between.

There is an understanding that emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. It is the faculty born when the self remains porous to the ordeal of being, the ground where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. This is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess—where understanding and un-understanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

As such, dark intelligibility is not the end of reason but its maturation. It operates by giving equal weight to the day of reason and the night of mystery. As Desmond powerfully suggests, our daytime reason risks going mad if it cannot return to and draw nourishment from the mystery of the night, just as a person who cannot sleep cannot properly return to the day.[D-youtube]

The chiaroscuro of dark intelligibility emerges precisely here—in the recognition that "The diurnal mind, sovereign of its clarities, drops down into sleep, and from deep within it horror floats up from bourns beyond the boundary of all definition."[D265] We are not simply moving from light to dark, but discovering that the darkness has its own luminosity, its own mode of disclosure. This requires acknowledging what Desmond calls "the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman"[D231]—a recognition that mystery is not merely the absence of clarity but a positive register of being.

## The Hyperluminous Dark

The ancients understood this paradox with striking precision. Aristotle's metaphor, echoed by Aquinas and developed in the Christian mystical tradition, captures it perfectly: with the highest things "we are like bats in sunlight."[D273] Our daytime reason finds itself blinded precisely where nocturnal intuition might navigate. The metaphor reveals something essential—that what we call "darkness" in relation to ultimate matters is not obscurity but *hyperluminosity*. The divine light, as Gregory of Nyssa understood, is so intense it appears as darkness to finite minds—not because God is obscure but because the revelation exceeds our capacity to receive it.

This inverts the Enlightenment's confidence in reason's illuminating power. With ultimate matters, our clearest concepts become the very blindness that prevents seeing. The more we try to grasp being through determinate categories, the more we obscure what shows itself only to those who have learned to see differently. Nocturnal souls—those who have undergone the metabolic transformation of consciousness—find that what appeared as daylight clarity was itself a kind of darkness, while what seemed impenetrably obscure reveals itself as luminous.

*Dark* intelligibility, then, names not the absence of light but its overwhelming presence. It is intelligence that has learned to navigate by a different luminosity, one that doesn't eliminate mystery but draws nourishment from it. The darkness is not what we must overcome to achieve clarity, but the very medium through which ultimate things disclose themselves to consciousness sufficiently porous to receive them.

This understanding echoes through traditions. Plato's cave-dwellers, blinded by the sun when first exposed, must learn to see by the very light that initially overwhelms them. The mystic's *via negativa* strips away determinate concepts not to reach blankness but to open to what cannot be grasped yet can be known through intimate participation. Nishitani's field of emptiness is not nihilistic void but the fertile ground where all determinate beings find their suchness.

Dark intelligibility is thus a form of *non-propositional knowing* that requires attunement and fidelity to mystery, revealing the limits of conceptual thought while grounding it in embodied wisdom. It is what Desmond calls agapeic mindfulness—an unknowing knowing, a *docta ignorantia*. "One hesitates even to call it knowing lest one imply one has grasped a determinate somewhat, mastered through oneself alone."[D273] This communication is excessive, extending beyond self-determining cognition into what can only be called "an excess of the other [that] strains the limits of self-determining."

The question of chiaroscuro returns here, but transformed. It's not about blending good and evil, or finding a middle path between affirmation and negation. I'm beginning to see it is about witnessing their terrible co-constitutiveness, and in that witnessing, consenting to a reality our morality finds scandalous.

The scandal is the sheer, unblinking `that-it-is` of being. It is what Desmond calls the "idiocy" of being, and it is difficult to reconcile. It points to a total 'letting-be' that feels, to our human sense, like an abdication. Desmond speaks of the scandal of an "ultimate patience" in the divine, a giving that "may seem to have vanished into anonymity, seeking no reward... nothing at all."[D320] This is the patience that allows for all freedom, but also for all horror. It doesn't conform to our moral calculus.

Lispector touches the same nerve when she finds the moral problem "not only overwhelming, but extremely petty." She asks, "Am I moral to the extent that I do what I should, and feel as I should?" before concluding, "The ethics of the moral is keeping it secret. Freedom is a secret."[L59] Perhaps the freedom to truly see this hyperluminous dark requires a secret initiation: a letting go of the petty moral framework of what "ought to be" in order to receive the scandalous, idiotic truth of what simply *is*. This requires more than just looking; it requires a transformation of the eyes.

## Somatic Depths and Metabolic Wisdom

This points to forms of knowing that operate through what can be called *metabolic wisdom*—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension. Somatic practices are conducive of energetic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being."[L173] The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

Dark intelligibility operates from what Nishitani calls *ontological samadhi*: "In its own home-ground, the being of the self is essentially a sort of samadhi. No matter how dispersed the conscious self be, its self as it is in itself is ever in samadhi."[N165-166] This is not meditative achievement but our deepest structure. Even in turbulence, confusion, the metabolic crisis of ordeal—at the ground, there is samadhi. A stillness that precedes and enables all our motion, a dark knowing that operates even when daylight consciousness fails. Dark intelligibility is learning to think *from* this ontological primacy rather from the dispersed, anxious surface consciousness. It's intelligence that draws from the home-ground, knowing that rests in what Nishitani, consonant with Desmond's metaxu, calls the "middle": "Our self in itself is most elementally 'middle.'"[N166] The immediate ground where we actually are, "at hand" and "underfoot," the point from which all our actions proceed with "absolute immediacy."

## The Grammar of Limits

Yet this new ground is not a place of absolute clarity. Dark Intelligibility operates not by eliminating limits, but by transforming our relationship to them. This brings us to the grammar of limits, where impasse itself becomes a mode of disclosure. In Lispector's work there is a tension between apophasis and phasis, negative and positive theology, saying what being is not and what it is. They are deeply entangled. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Dark intelligibility works at these limits—identifying them however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper-, hypo-).

Traditionally understood as a productive philosophical impasse that clears space for new thinking, aporia reveals something more paradoxical. It is not simply a luminous clearing but janus face of blockage and passage together. As we discovered through poros-sive-penia in the ordeal, the impasse is not the opposite of passage but its secret intensity. When poros withdraws, when the way recedes, we experience aporia—no way forward, no path visible. But this very blockage, if we can remain porous to it rather than flee from it, becomes the site where new passages open. The dead-end, metabolized rather than resisted, reveals itself as threshold.

This is the double nature of aporia itself: blockage *and* breakthrough, simultaneously. What appears as obstacle to our daylight consciousness reveals itself, to nocturnal awareness, as the very condition for transformation. The way opens precisely through its recession. Passage emerges from within impasse.

## Perplexity as Metabolic Resistance

"Perplexity seeds a troubled thinking in porosity that makes us patient to given otherness."[D119] Perplexity—that troubled thinking in porosity—is the middle space between overdetermined being and our need for determinate articulation. It's the resistance we encounter when trying to make the indefinite definite, to domesticate the mystery of our being.

There is something of suffering in this perplexity, as in astonishment. Being in the between is first a suffering; we undergo our being given to be. Perplexity cannot be eliminated, only metabolized. Mystery will always resist our attempts at eradication. The troubling perplexity must be borne rather than solved.

Dark intelligibility learns to treat aporia not as obstacle to be overcome but as what Desmond calls hyperintelligibility—excessive intelligibility that exceeds our capacity to master it. We make present the negativity: the discomfort, shadow, frustrated meaning, limits of language. We highlight the insufficiency of pure daylight reason and reveal the urgency for night's mystery to meet its conjunction with day. This isn't the via negativa of *neti neti* ("not this, not that") but something more visceral—making the blockage itself luminous.

The paradox requires what Desmond calls "idiotic trust"—the "overdeterminate faith" that "is other to determinate and self-determining reason" yet "is not absurd; it is the mustard seed of agapeic minding in us."[D340] We trust that the way opens precisely through its own recession, that passage emerges from within the impasse itself.

## The Practice of Bearing More

This transformation is not a static achievement but an ongoing practice: the practice of bearing more. It is the development of a spiritual metabolism robust enough to process reality's "murky bile" as well as its joys. Both dreams and entheogens are more transparent to the "no" and can bring us closer to the deeper yes through the yes-sive-no. A wholeness that can hold and work with the totality. It doesn't have to be perfect but there is a sense of attending to it that then widens our capacity to bear more. That is the practice. When we are communicating, that is when the medicine gets flowing and our capacity becomes greater. But with that power comes a double movement for holding more suffering as well. The metaxu of an equanimity between oppositions, not fully resolved but balanced. Not counterfeit yeses but the communication of a deeper affirmation, our original affirmation.

The key recognition here is that your affirmation and negation is not just an existential but a bodily, ontological concern. It takes our "multimodal" ways of knowing to bear the excess of reality. To receive the medicine.

To suffer and undergo the ordeal in that sense is to restore communication to ourselves and the world. But what if we do not take the communication? What if we cannot receive it? The capacity for horror, the absurd arises from that failure. No resolution but failure of communication. Every comprehension itself is an "acute incomprehension" and exposed to the hyperintelligible there always remains a part inaccessible, incommunicable, one that remains enigmatic and fiery at the center of things, a terrible power and infinite source of energy that flows directly to us.

## Thought Singing Its Other

Dark intelligibility is not anti-rational thinking but *hyperrational*—reason stretched to its creative limits. Desmond traces a movement from *thought thinking itself* (Hegel's self-closing dialectic) to *thought thinking its Other*, and finally to *thought singing its Other*. In this "singing," thought becomes a celebratory, performative, and porous act—an ecstasis that does not seek to possess the other, but to witness it.

This is the language of praise. Thought singing its other is thought that has learned to let beings be, to witness them in their suchness, to participate in their self-manifestation without interference. Lispector's final words in *The Passion According to G.H.* capture this perfectly: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it."[L175] She doesn't comprehend the roach, the neutral, the worse truth—and precisely in that non-comprehension, she can finally sing them.

When we sing deeply through the other, the other starts singing back to us. The tree sings its treeness; in witnessing that without demand, we enable it to sing more fully; and as if in unison, its song then confirms our own existence. An intimacy so alien and yet so near.

## The Energy of Eros Transformed

Having undergone the ordeal, having discovered ourselves as poros-sive-penia, we now understand differently the energy that moves us. We are not simply troubled by desire—we *are* the trouble, the restlessness strung across the abyss between having and not-having. But now this restlessness has been metabolized, transformed from blind compulsion into conscious participation.

The wisdom lies not in resolving the tension between penia and poros but in orchestrating their tandem movement. The kenotic opening is tempered by hunger's vitality; the hungry reaching is tempered by opening's receptivity. Each checks the other's potential for distortion. Together they create what Lispector calls "a love full of fury"[L158-159]—love that includes both the gentleness of receptivity and the intensity of need.

This is metaxological desire that has matured into agapeic love: desire that has learned to dwell in the between without collapsing it, that can hold the tension without fleeing into false resolutions. It is desire aware of its own groundlessness, consenting to the restlessness as fundamental rather than provisional, yet finding in this very restlessness the energy for generous giving.

## Union-in-Difference: The Harvest

The ultimate harvest of this transformation is a new way of loving that resolves a beautiful paradox. On one hand, Desmond's God gives an asymmetrical, unreturnable gift of being—a gift so total that it is "foreign... to our (all too erotic) conceptual economies"[PU195]. We can never repay it. On the other hand, the transformed experience is one of profound reciprocity: being "confirmed by all things."

The resolution is the heart of the matter: our "singing back," our act of confirming the other, is not an attempt to repay the gift. It is the most complete and profound way of receiving it. Because the gift was that we be "freely released into being for ourselves"[D257], we honor that freedom most fully by becoming free givers in our turn. We receive the gift of being by participating in the ongoing act of creation.

This act of grateful, reciprocal loving is a finite participation in the infinite Agapeic Origin. Our achieved agapeic love is a creaturely echo of God's primordial "letting the other be." This is the meaning of *union-in-difference*. We remain finite creatures, receivers of the gift (the difference), yet we are brought into conscious, loving communion with the divine source through our own acts of giving (the union).

The heteronomy we feared—possession by the other—reveals itself as the call of our own deepest being. What seemed alien intrusion is our original participation. We are not dissolved but discovered, not possessed but released into our truest selfhood—one that sings with rather than against the world.

Desmond's 'absolved relativity' names what we achieve through dark intelligibility: relation freed from the demand to possess or be possessed. We are absolved—released—into genuine togetherness. Not dissolved into unity, not scattered into isolation, but held in the between where genuine selves can sing to genuine others. This is relation transfigured by agapeic generosity: each term released to be itself precisely through its openness to the other.

The hopeless joy we discovered is the emotional register of this absolved relativity. Joy without hope because it needs no future completion—it is already complete in its incompletion, already whole in its openness. We are absolved of the need to mean something beyond this singing, this festivity of being-between.

When I sing the other, I find myself in love. Enchanted and chanting. The boundaries dissolve. The world becomes an inhuman mirror, showing me the matter-of-God that constitutes me. The alien becomes intimate; the foreign reveals itself as home. I long to sleep under the moss, to become compost under a thick blanket of dew, to participate in the slow, silent festivity. A glimpse of a singing khora, that primordial receptacle now understood not as passive container but as active participant in the cosmic singing. The metaxu itself sings, and when we have learned to listen, we discover we have always been part of that song, and that our voice is needed for the chorus to be complete, that the world waits patiently for our participation in its self-manifestation.

## Departure, Arrival, Return

Dark intelligibility is not a destination but a movement—an oscillating rhythm between departure, arrival, and return that constitutes the metabolic practice of being in the metaxu. This is not a linear progression from ignorance to enlightenment, but a cycle that honors all directions as necessary dimensions of the same lived truth.

We are always already in motion—departure, arrival, return—and fidelity to flux means consenting to this rhythm rather than trying to arrest it at any single point. But this consent is not passive acceptance. It is sustained attention in the face of inevitable reterritorialization, inevitable forgetting. After the experience comes amnesis—the fading of the revelation, the return to ordinary consciousness. Yet something remains: not the peak experience but the metabolic capacity developed through it.

The practice is learning to trust this cycle, to know that departure will come again, that the ordinary contains the seeds of the extraordinary, that even our forgetting participates in a larger remembering. This is what it means to become companionable rather than possessed—to learn the rhythm of approach and withdrawal, presence and absence, revelation and concealment.

## Courage, Connection, Participation

Courage, participation, connection—this is what agapeic love asks of us. The courage to remain open to what exceeds us. The participation in creation that happens when we stop imposing and start witnessing. The connection to self and world that reveals itself when we discover these are not separate domains but interpenetrating dimensions of the same original part.

"The quiet festivity of agapeic of being"[D164]—an intimate joy in us participating in creation, a mutual bringing-forth of reality. This is the Great Affirmation in its lived reality: not abstract yes to being, but intimate participation in being's festivity. The metabolic transformation that began in ordeal, that passed through the ruins of meaning and the terror of the neutral, arrives finally at this: we learn to sing, and in singing, we are sung. We find our resting place not by escaping the between but by discovering the between as home, the metaxu as the very ground of wholeness.

Dark intelligibility and agapeic love are not separate achievements but two dimensions of the same transformation: a way of knowing that is simultaneously a way of loving, a receptivity that is simultaneously an affirmation, a vulnerability that is simultaneously a strength. This is the fruit of the ordeal, the harvest of metabolic development, the gift that was always already present in the pharmakon we feared would destroy us.

## Toward Ontological Nutrition

This entire framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be understood as sophisticated technologies for *metabolic development*—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range: learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on being itself without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

The roach encounter becomes a genuine philosophical experiment in *ontological nutrition*—testing whether human consciousness can learn to subsist on unsalted being, to find sustenance in neutrality itself. Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

A new form of knowing occurs: our unknowing-sive-knowing. A knowing that is closer to a kind of touching, an encounter contact with the divine that feels as a confirmation of ourselves with God. Being becomes communion. Being at that state is a pure nakedness before God. And after everything is burned away what remains is an entry into the palace in a union-in-difference. Our neediness is replaced with peace. We are already forgiven.

## Coda: The Question of Companionability

The journey that began by asking how we might become companionable to what threatens to possess us finds its answer here. Agapeic love is the name for that perfected companionability—a way of being with the other that is intimate without consuming, and porous without being destroyed.

Companionability is still also a question for the questioning of autonomy versus heteronomy. Is there a point at which autonomy as we know it collapses? In the text, there is a deeper selfhood that emerges in non-duality. But as the cycle of departure-arrival-return reveals, our "arrival" is one part of the pendulum swing and the amnesis from the "return" challenges us to remain at the metaxu. On the one hand, we do not want to constantly be exposed to excess, we couldn't go on living. Yet simultaneously we do not want to lose touch with overdeterminacy. This is the kind of ongoing practice that never stops. Walking the thin line between eros turannos and ouranios, between self and other, between the finite and infinite.

The question, then, was never how to avoid the ordeal, but how to bear it. We learn not through mastery, but through metabolization. We learn to receive the "superplus" of being by becoming porous enough not to be shattered by its grace. We learn to find nourishment in the very shadow of our nothingness, to discover that the pharmakon's poison, when fully tasted, is the medicine.

The journey that began in a "sweet and abysmal vertigo"[L29] does not end in certainty. It ends in communion. The vertigo is no longer a disorientation to be overcome, but the very rhythm of the "quiet festivity of being." We find our home not by escaping the between, but by learning to sing in it.

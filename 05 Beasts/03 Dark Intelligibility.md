# Dark Intelligibility

*"Not dark, just without light"*
—Clarice Lispector

## Beyond Witch and Mystic

Initially encountering Clarice Lispector's work, I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, designated with terms like 'dark femininity' or 'witchcraft'. Her friend Otto Lara Resende famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, dangerous, alien. And on the other hand, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'.

I feel an unease with the cultural framing of Lispector as "witch" or "mystic". Even in framing "witch" as an empowering, subversive, counter-dogmatic—this can still reinforce the patriarchal logic of marginalization. Framed as an outsider this could still perpetuate rather than challenge the structures that created exclusion. Beyond that, why subscribe to any binary?

What's at stake in Lispector isn't the romanticization of marginality but something more fundamental: the recognition that authentic encounter with being necessarily exceeds categorical frameworks. Even canonical female mystics like Hildegard, Teresa, or Julian retain their rupturing power not through institutional legitimacy but through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated.

The contemplations of Augustine's *intimior intimo meo*, for example, retain their rupturing power precisely through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated. When we encounter Teresa's *Interior Castle* or Eckhart's sermons, what moves us isn't their institutional legitimacy but the immediate presence of someone who has been there—the trembling authenticity that no amount of theological framework can fully contain or explain.

What is framed as feminine porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening represents a methodological approach. To be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, our idolization of autonomy.

## The Method of Dark Intelligibility

**Dark Intelligibility** is the understanding that emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. It is the faculty that is born when the self remains porous to the ordeal of being, the ground where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. It is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess—where understanding and ununderstanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

As such, Dark Intelligibility is not the end of reason, but its maturation. It is a form of non-propositional knowing that requires attunement and fidelity to the nourishing mystery of the night that grounds our daytime reason. This intelligence doesn't oppose rational thought but reveals its limits and provides its ground—the places where conceptual knowledge must give way to embodied wisdom.

In yoga practice, people often experience somatic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. This points to forms of knowing that operate through **metabolic wisdom**—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension.

Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this dark intelligibility in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being." The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

## Apophasis and Phasis: The Grammar of Limits

In Lispector's work there is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Perhaps this is what I'm trying to articulate with Dark Intelligibility. As a work on limits we identify the limits, however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper - hypo).

Dark intelligibility is not anti-rational thinking but hyperrational—reason stretched to its creative limits. Desmond traces a similar movement from *thought thinking itself* (Hegel's self-closing dialectic) to *thought thinking its Other*, and finally to *thought singing its Other*. In this "singing," thought becomes a celebratory, performative, and porous act—an ecstasis that does not seek to possess the other, but to witness it. This is the responsive finesse that dark intelligibility cultivates. Lispector's final words capture this: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it."

The adoration that emerges from not-understanding signals intelligence that has learned to think at the edge of thought itself. The saltless truth demands nothing less than a transformation of intelligence—from grasping to receiving, from solving to dissolving. This transformation is intimately linked to the Pharmakon of Being, as our metabolic capacity is ultimately a measure of our ability to receive communication. When we remain open to the "shown and the reserved" nature of being, we can metabolize the experience. When that communication breaks down into the absurd, the pharmakon becomes poison. "This perplexity grows into unknowing the more growing into knowing." (p.120, God and the Between)

# Dark Intelligibility

### Metabolic Knowing

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. It is here, in the ruins of the old self, that astonishment begins again. This metabolic relationship points toward a new mode of knowing. Not an end to reason, but its maturation into a faculty that can dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

There is an understanding that emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. It is the faculty born when the self remains porous to the ordeal of being, the ground where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. This is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess—where understanding and un-understanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

As such, dark intelligibility is not the end of reason but its maturation. It operates by giving equal weight to the day of reason and the night of mystery. As Desmond powerfully suggests, our daytime reason risks going mad if it cannot return to and draw nourishment from the mystery of the night, just as a person who cannot sleep cannot properly return to the day.[^24]

The chiaroscuro of dark intelligibility emerges precisely here—in the recognition that "The diurnal mind, sovereign of its clarities, drops down into sleep, and from deep within it horror floats up from bourns beyond the boundary of all definition."[^25] We are not simply moving from light to dark, but discovering that the darkness has its own luminosity, its own mode of disclosure. This requires acknowledging what Desmond calls "the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman"[^26]—a recognition that mystery is not merely the absence of clarity but a positive register of being.

Like Aristotle's metaphor, echoed by Aquinas, that with the highest things "we are like bats in sunlight"[^27]—our daytime reason finds itself blinded precisely where nocturnal intuition might navigate. Nocturnal souls find the daylight itself a nighttime illumination.

Dark intelligibility is thus a form of **non-propositional knowing** that requires attunement and fidelity to mystery, revealing the limits of conceptual thought while grounding it in embodied wisdom. It is what Desmond calls **"agapeic mindfulness"**—an unknowing knowing, a *docta ignorantia*. "One hesitates even to call it knowing lest one imply one has grasped a determinate somewhat, mastered through oneself alone."[^28] This communication is excessive, extending beyond self-determining cognition into what can only be called "an excess of the other [that] strains the limits of self-determining."

This points to forms of knowing that operate through what can be called **metabolic wisdom**—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension. Somatic practices are conducive of energetic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being." The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

Dark intelligibility operates from what Nishitani calls **ontological samadhi**: "In its own home-ground, the being of the self is essentially a sort of samadhi. No matter how dispersed the conscious self be, its self as it is in itself is ever in samadhi."[^29] This is not meditative achievement but our deepest structure. Even in turbulence, confusion, the metabolic crisis of ordeal—at the ground, there is samadhi. A stillness that precedes and enables all our motion, a dark knowing that operates even when daylight consciousness fails. Dark intelligibility is learning to think *from* this ontological primacy rather than from the dispersed, anxious surface consciousness. It's intelligence that draws from the home-ground, knowing that rests in what Nishitani, consonant with Desmond's metaxu, calls the "middle": "Our self in itself is most elementally 'middle.'"[^30] the immediate ground where we actually are, "at hand" and "underfoot," the point from which all our actions proceed with "absolute immediacy.

#### The Grammar of Limits

Yet this new ground is not a place of absolute clarity. Dark Intelligibility operates not by eliminating limits, but by transforming our relationship to them. This brings us to the grammar of limits, where impasse itself becomes a mode of disclosure. In Lispector's work there is a tension between apophasis and phasis, negative and positive theology, saying what being is not and what it is. They are deeply entangled. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Dark intelligibility works at these limits—identifying them however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper-, hypo-).

This work at limits brings us to the Greek concept of **aporia**—literally "without passage" or "waylessness." Traditionally understood as a productive philosophical impasse that clears space for new thinking, aporia reveals something more paradoxical. It is not simply a luminous clearing but janus face of blockage and passage together.

As Desmond explains, *poros* has connotations of "a way across." With no way across or through, we are at an impasse, an aporia. But poros isn't just passage—it names "a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way."[^31] **The way opens by withdrawing, creates passage through its own recession.**

This is the double nature of aporia itself. The blockage contains the resource for breakthrough, but only if we can metabolize the impasse rather than flee from it. What appears as dead-end becomes, for consciousness with sufficient metabolic capacity, the very site where new passages open.

##### Semantic Constipation and Porosity

"Sometimes rational univocity seems the callous of mind that hardens over the porosity of our being... a remedial protective for vulnerability?"[^32] We become constipated with our own constructions of meaning. Language, meant to be porous medium, calcifies into barrier. Our determination of meaning can foreclose genuine relation, sealing the porosity where the bloodstream of life flows.

Yet this semantic blockage is itself pharmakon. The same meaning-making that opens worlds can become the prison that forecloses them. The construction that was medicine hardens into poison. But the blockage itself, when recognized and metabolized, becomes the pressure that forces breakthrough.

##### Perplexity as Metabolic Resistance

"Perplexity seeds a troubled thinking in porosity that makes us patient to given otherness."[^33] Perplexity—that troubled thinking in porosity—is the middle space between overdetermined being and our need for determinate articulation. It's the resistance we encounter when trying to make the indefinite definite, to domesticate the mystery of our being.

There is something of suffering in this perplexity, as in astonishment. Being in the between is first a suffering; we undergo our being given to be. Perplexity cannot be eliminated, only metabolized. Mystery will always resist our attempts at eradication. The troubling perplexity must be borne rather than solved.

Dark intelligibility learns to treat aporia not as obstacle to be overcome but as what Desmond calls hyperintelligibility—excessive intelligibility that exceeds our capacity to master it. We make present the negativity: the discomfort, shadow, frustrated meaning, limits of language. We highlight the insufficiency of pure daylight reason and reveal the urgency for night's mystery to meet its conjunction with day. This isn't the via negativa of *neti neti* ("not this, not that") but something more visceral—**making the blockage itself luminous**.

The paradox requires what Desmond calls "idiotic trust"—the "overdeterminate faith" that "is other to determinate and self-determining reason" yet "is not absurd; it is the mustard seed of agapeic minding in us."[^34] We trust that the way opens precisely through its own recession, that passage emerges from within the impasse itself.

### Thought Singing Its Other

Dark intelligibility is not anti-rational thinking but **hyperrational**—reason stretched to its creative limits. Desmond traces a movement from *thought thinking itself* (Hegel's self-closing dialectic) to *thought thinking its Other*, and finally to *thought singing its Other*. In this "singing," thought becomes a celebratory, performative, and porous act—an ecstasis that does not seek to possess the other, but to witness it.

This is the language of praise. Thought singing its other is thought that has learned to let beings be, to witness them in their suchness, to participate in their self-manifestation without interference. Lispector's final words in *The Passion According to G.H.* capture this perfectly: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it." She doesn't comprehend the roach, the neutral, the worse truth—and precisely in that non-comprehension, she can finally sing them.

When we sing deeply through the other, the other starts singing back to us. The tree sings its treeness; in witnessing that without demand, we enable it to sing more fully; and as if in unison, its song then confirms our own existence. An intimacy so alien and yet so near. What seemed most foreign—the inhuman, the impersonal, the neutral—reveals itself as more intimate than we are to ourselves.

Truth demands nothing less than this transformation of intelligence—from grasping to receiving, from solving to dissolving. This transformation is intimately linked to the Pharmakon of Being: our metabolic capacity is ultimately a measure of our ability to receive communication. When we remain open to the "shown and the reserved" nature of being, we can metabolize the experience. When that communication breaks down into the absurd, the pharmakon becomes poison. As Desmond writes: "This perplexity grows into unknowing the more growing into knowing."[^35]

Agapeic love precedes our knowing—it is the primordial generosity of being itself, the surplus givenness that Desmond describes, the Great Affirmation that Nishitani names. We are always already held in this ground. The ordeal dissolves what prevented us from receiving what was always already gifted: the foreclosed porosity, the refusal to metabolize the neutral

Through our nocturnal knowing we become porous again to the agapeic ground. When thought stops grasping and begins singing, when perplexity is metabolized rather than solved, when the blockage becomes luminous—in these moments, we discover we are already loved, already held, already participating in being's quiet festivity.

### The Fruit of Agapeic Love

This agapeic love—this discovery that we are already held—gives birth to a transformed way of being in the world. The generous, non-possessive affirmation of the other in its pure, untamed otherness. Agapeic love is what remains when we have stopped trying to convert the neutral into something we can manage, when we have learned to receive the great living neutrality as it gives itself. It is love that has developed the metabolic capacity to affirm being without demanding that being conform to our needs for meaning, comfort, or redemption. It is the affective dimension of hopeless joy—a generous yes to suchness. But more than this: it is compassionate witnessing, the capacity to see beings in their own light, to let them be what they are without our projections obscuring their suchness.

This witnessing is not passive observation but active participation. It requires courage to remain open even when what we encounter exceeds our capacity to comprehend it. It demands connection—to self and world simultaneously, recognizing that these are not separate domains but interpenetrating fields of the same original part.

What Nishitani describes shows us how this works ontologically. After the conversion, after person-centered self-prehension is broken down, "the personal mode of being becomes more real, draws closer to the self, and appears in its true suchness."[^40] The paradox is that we become more genuinely personal by passing through the impersonal. "Insofar as the field of nothingness is completely one with personality and consciousness, the whole of this oneness is present within personality and consciousness. Conversely, insofar as personality and consciousness can be what they are only in oneness with absolute nothingness, the same complete oneness stands ecstatically outside of personality and consciousness. The absolute within and absolute without are here one and the same."[^41]

This is not mystical dissolution but the emergence of a higher 'person'—one that includes both personal intimacy and impersonal vastness. The "shadowy man" Nishitani speaks of, whose "heart and mind... originate from moment to moment as things completely temporary," yet "in their very temporality they stand ecstatically outside of time... altogether 'eternal' in their temporality."[^42] We become more ourselves by discovering we are not only ourselves.

Agapeic love recognizes this in the other as well. "Hills and rivers are here hills and rivers in not being hills and rivers, just as the self is the self in not being the self. And yet it is only here that hills and rivers are real hills and rivers in their suchness, only here that the self is the real self in its suchness."[^43] This is love that affirms beings in their emptiness, recognizing that their very groundlessness is their reality. To love agapeically is to see the other as "the self in not being the self"—fully other yet constituted by the same original part, different yet sharing the same home-ground.

### To Be Confirmed By All Things

But there is something more radical still. Dōgen writes: "To learn the Buddha Way is to learn one's self. To learn one's self is to forget one's self. To forget one's self is to be confirmed by all things."[^44]
What does it mean to be confirmed by all things? This is not mere recognition or validation. It is ontological reciprocity—when we have learned to witness beings in their suchness, they begin to witness us in ours. When we sing deeply through the other, the other starts singing back to us.
The roach confirms G.H. The white matter, when eaten, reveals her to herself more truly than her mirror ever did. The neutral, when received without flight, shows her "the thing-part... matter of God" that constitutes her. The inhuman reveals the human's deepest truth.

This is the phenomenology Nishitani articulates: "all things come forth and practice and confirm the self."[^45] When we have developed sufficient metabolic capacity, when we can remain porous to what exceeds us, beings begin to practice us—they work on us, teach us, reveal us to ourselves. "In bearing witness to this solitary one laid bare, each and every phenomenon is by far more itself than it is on its own home-ground."[^46] The more real we become, the more real everything else becomes. Our suchness enables their suchness; their suchness confirms ours.

This is a co-identification born out of mutual recognition in shared emptiness. I am empty; the roach is empty; this shared groundlessness is what allows genuine meeting. We recognize each other as "the self in not being the self," as expressions of the same original part taking different forms.

Desmond calls this "the quiet festivity of the agapeics of being"—a phrase that captures something essential. There is joy in this witnessing. Not the frantic joy of achievement but the quiet joy of participation, of finding ourselves part of something vastly larger than our constructed selves while simultaneously being utterly ourselves. An intimate joy in us participating in creation a mutual bringing-forth of reality.

#### Enchantment and the Agapeic Ground

When I sing the other, I find myself in love. Enchanted and chanting. The boundaries that kept me separate dissolve not into void but into intimacy. It is in this agapeic surrender that the heart burns through the fabric of reality—not destroying it but making it transparent, revealing what was always already there.

This is wanting to be met and being met by myself through the world. Not narcissistic self-reflection but the discovery that the world is the medium of self-encounter. I meet myself on my home-ground and lose myself there. The circuminsessional relationship Nishitani describes becomes lived experience: I find myself one with nature, yet more myself than I've ever been. "The self is the self in not being the self"—this is not conceptual paradox but phenomenological reality.

It is a divine meeting with an Other, an inhuman mirror of myself. The roach, the tree, the stone—each shows me what I am by being utterly other than what I think I am. Each reveals the thing-part, the original part, the matter-of-God that constitutes me. The alien becomes intimate; the foreign reveals itself as home.

This is the agapeic ground in which I am completely and absolutely whole—not by excluding what I feared or rejected, but by discovering that the neutral itself is fertile, that the inhuman is nearer than my human constructions, that emptiness is my substance. It is my resting place in my soul—that ontological samadhi Nishitani speaks of, the stillness at the ground that persists through all turbulence, the home I never left even when I felt most lost.

A flash of union—not permanent fusion but fleeting glimpse of mutual participation in being's self-manifestation. A glimpse of a singing khora, that primordial receptacle now understood not as passive container but as active participant in the cosmic singing. The metaxu itself sings, and when we have learned to listen, we discover we have always been part of that song, that our voice is needed for the chorus to be complete, that the world waits for our participation in its self-manifestation.

Courage, participation, connection—this is what agapeic love asks of us. The courage to remain open to what exceeds us. The participation in creation that happens when we stop imposing and start witnessing. The connection to self and world that reveals itself when we discover these are not separate domains but interpenetrating dimensions of the same original part. Desmond calls this "the quiet festivity of the agapeics of being"—an intimate joy in us participating in creation, a mutual bringing-forth of reality.

This is the Great Affirmation in its lived reality: not abstract yes to being, but intimate participation in being's festivity. The metabolic transformation that began in ordeal, that passed through the ruins of meaning and the terror of the neutral, arrives finally at this: we learn to sing, and in singing, we are sung. We find our resting place not by escaping the between but by discovering the between as home, the metaxu as the very ground of wholeness.

Dark intelligibility and agapeic love are not separate achievements but two dimensions of the same transformation: a way of knowing that is simultaneously a way of loving, a receptivity that is simultaneously an affirmation, a vulnerability that is simultaneously a strength. This is the fruit of the ordeal, the harvest of metabolic development, the gift that was always already present in the pharmakon we feared would destroy us.

### Toward Ontological Nutrition

This entire framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be understood as sophisticated technologies for **metabolic development**—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range: learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on being itself without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

The roach encounter becomes a genuine philosophical experiment in **ontological nutrition**—testing whether human consciousness can learn to subsist on unsalted being, to find sustenance in neutrality itself. Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

The Pharmakon of Being ultimately names both the challenge and the promise of existence: the same reality that can dissolve unprepared consciousness becomes, for those with sufficient metabolic capacity, the deepest form of nourishment available to human awareness.

We desperately need **ritual containers**, **philosophical depth**, and **existential courage** to meet the ambiguity that the pharmakon reveals. A truthful spiritual practice should include the whole spectrum, the yes and the no, the gift and the debt. The fundamental ambiguity of any practice is not something to be eliminated but engaged with **finesse rather than geometry**—the responsive attunement of dark intelligibility rather than the calculative mastery of technical reason.

The pharmakon of being cannot be resolved through scientific taxonomy but must be lived, metabolized, and integrated through mature spiritual practice within wisdom traditions that understand transformation's necessarily equivocal waters. The question isn't how to avoid the ordeal but how to bear it, how to let it work on us until the blockage itself becomes the clearing, until we find ourselves saying yes to what we cannot yet comprehend, trusting that the way opens precisely through its own recession.

# Dark Intelligibility

>"Not dark but just without light."
>—Clarice Lispector, *The Passion According to G.H.*

## Metabolic Knowing

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. It is here, in the ruins of the old self, that astonishment begins again. This metabolic relationship points toward a new mode of knowing. Not an end to reason, but its maturation into a faculty that can dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

What nihilism clears, dark intelligibility learns to inhabit. Not the restoration of old meanings but a new way of dwelling in the between.

There is an understanding that emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. It is the faculty born when the self remains porous to the ordeal of being, the ground where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. This is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess—where understanding and un-understanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

As such, dark intelligibility is not the end of reason but its maturation. It operates by giving equal weight to the day of reason and the night of mystery. As Desmond powerfully suggests, our daytime reason risks going mad if it cannot return to and draw nourishment from the mystery of the night, just as a person who cannot sleep cannot properly return to the day.[D-youtube]

The chiaroscuro of dark intelligibility emerges precisely here—in the recognition that "The diurnal mind, sovereign of its clarities, drops down into sleep, and from deep within it horror floats up from bourns beyond the boundary of all definition."[D265] We are not simply moving from light to dark, but discovering that the darkness has its own luminosity, its own mode of disclosure. This requires acknowledging what Desmond calls "the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman"[D231]—a recognition that even darkness is a vital communication.

## The Hyperluminous Dark

The ancients understood this paradox with striking precision. Aristotle's metaphor, echoed by Aquinas and developed in the Christian mystical tradition, captures it perfectly: with the highest things "we are like bats in sunlight."[D273] Our daytime reason finds itself blinded precisely where nocturnal intuition might navigate. The metaphor reveals something essential—that what we call "darkness" in relation to ultimate matters is not obscurity but *hyperluminosity*. The divine light, as Gregory of Nyssa understood, is so intense it appears as darkness to finite minds—not because God is obscure but because the revelation exceeds our capacity to receive it.

This inverts the Enlightenment's confidence in reason's illuminating power. With ultimate matters, our clearest concepts become the very blindness that prevents seeing. The more we try to grasp being through determinate categories, the more we obscure what shows itself only to those who have learned to see differently. Nocturnal souls—those who have undergone the metabolic transformation of consciousness—find that what appeared as daylight clarity was itself a kind of darkness, while what seemed impenetrably obscure reveals itself as luminous.

*Dark* intelligibility, then, names not the absence of light but its overwhelming presence. It is intelligence that has learned to navigate by a different luminosity, one that doesn't eliminate mystery but draws nourishment from it. The darkness is not what we must overcome to achieve clarity, but the very medium through which ultimate things disclose themselves to consciousness sufficiently porous to receive them.

This understanding echoes through traditions. Plato's cave-dwellers, blinded by the sun when first exposed, must learn to see by the very light that initially overwhelms them. The mystic's *via negativa* strips away determinate concepts not to reach blankness but to open to what cannot be grasped yet can be known through intimate participation. Nishitani's field of emptiness is not nihilistic void but the fertile ground where all determinate beings find their suchness.

Dark intelligibility is thus a form of *non-propositional knowing* that requires attunement and fidelity to mystery, revealing the limits of conceptual thought while grounding it in embodied wisdom. It is what Desmond calls agapeic mindfulness—an unknowing knowing, a *docta ignorantia*. "One hesitates even to call it knowing lest one imply one has grasped a determinate somewhat, mastered through oneself alone."[D273] This communication is excessive, extending beyond self-determining cognition into what can only be called "an excess of the other [that] strains the limits of self-determining."

The question of chiaroscuro returns here, but transformed. It's not about blending good and evil, or finding a middle path between affirmation and negation. I'm beginning to see it is about witnessing their terrible co-constitutiveness, and in that witnessing, consenting to a reality our morality finds scandalous.

The scandal is the sheer, unblinking *that-it-is* of being. It is what Desmond calls the "idiocy" of being, and it is difficult to reconcile. It points to a total 'letting-be' that feels, to our human sense, like an abdication. Desmond speaks of the scandal of an "ultimate patience" in the divine, a giving that "may seem to have vanished into anonymity, seeking no reward... nothing at all."[D320] This is the patience that allows for all freedom, but also for all horror. It doesn't conform to our moral calculus.

Lispector touches the same nerve when she finds the moral problem "not only overwhelming, but extremely petty." She asks, "Am I moral to the extent that I do what I should, and feel as I should?" before concluding, "The ethics of the moral is keeping it secret. Freedom is a secret."[L59] Perhaps the freedom to truly see this hyperluminous dark requires a secret initiation: a letting go of the petty moral framework of what "ought to be" in order to receive the scandalous, idiotic truth of what simply *is*. This requires more than just looking; it requires a transformation of the eyes.

## Somatic Depths and Metabolic Wisdom

This points to forms of knowing that operate through what can be called *metabolic wisdom*—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension. Somatic practices are conducive of energetic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being."[L173] The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

We do not control our breathing, our heartbeat, our digestion—yet these are the very processes that constitute our being. The body participates in being without our permission, whether the mind consents or not. This is heteronomy in its deepest sense: we are constituted by what we do not master, sustained by processes we do not command, embodied in a way that exceeds our autonomy.

The body's heteronomy is our deepest relationality. We are not self-contained subjects but porous participants in a larger ecology of being. The mind's illusion of autonomy can only be shattered when brought face-to-face with the body's inescapable interdependence.

Dark intelligibility learns to think *from* this heteronomous ground rather than against it. When Nishitani speaks of our self being "most elementally middle," he names what the body already enacts: we are not autonomous origins but metabolic middles, perpetually transforming what we receive into what we give, simultaneously receiver and giver, dependent and generative. The body is the living metaxu.

Here Desmond and Nishitani converge from opposite shores. What Desmond calls the metaxu—the porous, intermediate space of communicative being—Nishitani names the field of śūnyatā. There is a deep resonance and co-identification here. Both reject substantialism: the metaxu is not a 'third thing' between self and other; śūnyatā is not a void but the condition for beings to be in their suchness. Both describe radical relationality: Desmond's *communicative community* and Nishitani's *circuminsessional interpenetration* name the same structure—a field where each thing is itself precisely through its openness to all others. While Desmond stresses the preservation of genuine otherness within relation; Nishitani stresses the non-dual character of the field itself. Neither sacrifices what the other emphasizes. The metaxu-as-śūnyatā is the groundless ground where transcendence and interpenetration co-arise.

Dark intelligibility operates from what Nishitani calls *ontological samadhi*: "In its own home-ground, the being of the self is essentially a sort of samadhi. No matter how dispersed the conscious self be, its self as it is in itself is ever in samadhi."[N165-166] This is not meditative achievement but our deepest structure. Even in turbulence, confusion, the metabolic crisis of ordeal—at the ground, there is samadhi. A stillness that precedes and enables all our motion, a dark knowing that operates even when daylight consciousness fails. Dark intelligibility is learning to think *from* this ontological primacy rather from the dispersed, anxious surface consciousness. It's intelligence that draws from the home-ground, knowing that rests in what Nishitani, consonant with Desmond's metaxu, calls the "middle": "Our self in itself is most elementally 'middle.'"[N166] The immediate ground where we actually are, "at hand" and "underfoot," the point from which all our actions proceed with "absolute immediacy."

## The Grammar of Limits

Yet this new ground is not a place of absolute clarity. Dark Intelligibility operates not by eliminating limits, but by transforming our relationship to them. This brings us to the grammar of limits, where impasse itself becomes a mode of disclosure. In Lispector's work there is a tension between apophasis and phasis, negative and positive theology, saying what being is not and what it is. They are deeply entangled. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Dark intelligibility works at these limits—identifying them however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper-, hypo-).

Traditionally understood as a productive philosophical impasse that clears space for new thinking, aporia reveals something more paradoxical. It is not simply a luminous clearing but janus face of blockage and passage together. As we discovered through *poros*-*sive*-*penia* in the ordeal, the impasse is not the opposite of passage but its secret intensity. When *poros* withdraws, when the way recedes, we experience aporia—no way forward, no path visible. But this very blockage, if we can remain porous to it rather than flee from it, becomes the site where new passages open. The dead-end, metabolized rather than resisted, reveals itself as threshold.

This is the double nature of aporia itself: blockage *and* breakthrough, simultaneously. What appears as obstacle to our daylight consciousness reveals itself, to nocturnal awareness, as the very condition for transformation. The way opens precisely through its recession. Passage emerges from within impasse.

## Perplexity as Metabolic Resistance

"Perplexity seeds a troubled thinking in porosity that makes us patient to given otherness."[D119] Perplexity—that troubled thinking in porosity—is the middle space between overdetermined being and our need for determinate articulation. It's the resistance we encounter when trying to make the indefinite definite, to domesticate the mystery of our being.

There is something of suffering in this perplexity, as in astonishment. Being in the between is first a suffering; we undergo our being given to be. Perplexity cannot be eliminated, only metabolized. Mystery will always resist our attempts at eradication. The troubling perplexity must be borne rather than solved.

Yet perplexity itself transforms through the ordeal. Before the metabolic transformation, perplexity appears as obstacle—the frustrating inability to grasp, the collapse of our conceptual frameworks, the maddening resistance of reality to our categories. This is perplexity as suffering, as crisis, as breakdown. We are troubled by being, troubled by thinking, troubled by the very fact that things resist our attempts to domesticate them. This perplexity threatens to overwhelm us, to drive us either toward nihilistic refusal or toward counterfeit certainties that foreclose genuine encounter.

After the metabolic transformation—or rather, *through* the practice of bearing it—perplexity reveals its other face: not obstacle but opening, not breakdown but breakthrough. Perplexity becomes the very *mode* of dark intelligibility. We remain troubled, yes—but now the trouble is metabolized, transformed from paralysis into a dynamic porosity. This is perplexity as gift: the perpetual reminder that reality exceeds our grasp, that mystery remains irreducible, that the between is inexhaustible. We no longer need to eliminate perplexity; we learn to dwell *in* it, to think *through* it, to let it seed new forms of understanding.

The transformation is not from perplexity to clarity but from perplexity-as-curse to perplexity-as-grace. The troubled thinking becomes itself a form of prayer, a way of staying open to what we cannot master. Patience here is not passive waiting but active receptivity—the metabolic capacity to remain present to what troubles us, to bear the resistance without demanding resolution.

Dark intelligibility learns to treat aporia not as obstacle to be overcome but as what Desmond calls hyperintelligibility[D244]—excessive intelligibility that exceeds our capacity to master it. Yet being also defeats understanding through what we might call *hypointelligibility*—the incomprehensibility of radical simplicity, the way suchness resists capture precisely in being irreducibly itself. The roach is simultaneously hyperintelligible (overwhelming presence, hypersalient actuality) and hypointelligible (*just roach*, stripped of all imposed meaning, bare suchness). This is *emptiness-sive-plenitude* in double exposure.

Here Desmond and Nishitani converge from opposite emphases. Desmond's *surplus givenness*—being as overdeterminate excess—meets Nishitani's *sunyata*—being as the empty field where things appear in their suchness. These are not contradictions but complementary disclosures of the same porous encounter. The neutral is both stripped (empty of our categories) and saturated (full of its own overwhelming actuality). Western philosophy emphasizes the plenitude; Eastern philosophy emphasizes the emptiness. Metaxological thinking holds both in tension, recognizing that being escapes our grasp whether we face its overwhelming fullness or its overwhelming bareness.

We make present the negativity: the discomfort, shadow, frustrated meaning, limits of language. We highlight the insufficiency of pure daylight reason and reveal the urgency for night's mystery to meet its conjunction with day. This isn't the via negativa of *neti neti* ("not this, not that") but something more visceral—making the blockage itself luminous, whether that blockage manifests as excessive plenitude or radical poverty.

The paradox requires what Desmond calls "idiotic trust"—the "overdeterminate faith" that "is other to determinate and self-determining reason" yet "is not absurd; it is the mustard seed of agapeic minding in us."[D340] We trust that the way opens precisely through its own recession, that passage emerges from within the impasse itself.

## The Practice of Bearing More

This transformation is not a static achievement but an ongoing practice: the practice of bearing more. It is the development of a spiritual metabolism robust enough to process reality's "murky bile" as well as its joys. Both dreams and entheogens are more transparent to the "no" and can bring us closer to the deeper yes through the yes-*sive*-no. A wholeness that can hold and work with the totality. It doesn't have to be perfect but there is a sense of attending to it that then widens our capacity to bear more. That is the practice. When we are communicating, that is when the medicine gets flowing and our capacity becomes greater. But with that power comes a double movement for holding more suffering as well. The metaxu of an equanimity between oppositions, not fully resolved but balanced. Not counterfeit yeses but the communication of a deeper affirmation, our original affirmation.

The key recognition here is that your affirmation and negation is not just an existential but a bodily, ontological concern. It takes our "multimodal" ways of knowing to bear the excess of reality. To receive the medicine.

The body bears what the mind cannot yet comprehend. Practices that work somatically—breathwork, movement, ritual—can expand our metabolic capacity in ways that purely mental work cannot. This is not anti-intellectual but recognizes that intelligence itself is embodied, that our capacity to receive reality's excess depends on our somatic attunement. The practice of bearing more is as much *philophysical* as philosophical, honoring the body's heteronomous participation in the transformation.

To suffer and undergo the ordeal in that sense is to restore communication to ourselves and the world. But what if we do not take the communication? What if we cannot receive it? The capacity for horror, the absurd arises from that failure. No resolution but failure of communication. Every comprehension itself is an "acute incomprehension" and exposed to the hyperintelligible there always remains a part inaccessible, incommunicable, one that remains enigmatic and fiery at the center of things, a terrible power and infinite source of energy that flows directly to us.

## Departure, Arrival, Return

The practice of bearing more is not a linear achievement but a cyclical rhythm—departure, arrival, return—that honors all directions as necessary dimensions of the same lived truth. We are always already in motion. The metabolic capacity we develop through ordeal doesn't eliminate the need for repeated transformation; rather, it prepares us for the ongoing cycle.

After the peak experience comes *amnesis*—the inevitable fading of the revelation, the return to ordinary consciousness. Yet something remains: not the experience itself but the expanded metabolic capacity, the widened ability to receive. We forget, yes—but we forget *differently*. The channel has been opened, even if it narrows again. The practice is learning to trust this rhythm, to know that departure will come again, that the ordinary contains seeds of the extraordinary, that even our forgetting participates in a larger remembering.

This is what distinguishes genuine transformation from mere peak experience. The peak comes and goes; the practice remains. We learn not to cling to the arrival (which would be to make an idol of the experience) nor to despair in the return (which would deny what was genuinely received). Fidelity to the between means consenting to flux itself—the pendulum swing between exposure to overdeterminacy and the necessary withdrawal into manageable determinacy.

We cannot remain constantly exposed to excess—we would burn out, unable to function in the world. Yet we cannot lose touch with overdeterminacy—we would fall back asleep to the familiar middle, into the comfortable domestication that refuses transformation. The practice is walking this line: between *eros turannos* and *eros ouranios*, between tyrannical possession and genuine participation, between self-enclosure and self-dissolution.

Companionability, then, is ongoing work rather than final achievement. We become companionable not by possessing the mystery once and for all but by learning the rhythm of approach and withdrawal, presence and absence, revelation and concealment. The ordeal taught us to metabolize what seemed like poison; the practice teaches us to trust the cycle, to find our footing in flux, to discover that home is not a fixed position but a dance.

## Thought Singing Its Other

Dark intelligibility is not anti-rational thinking but *hyperrational*—reason stretched to its creative limits. Desmond traces a movement from *thought thinking itself* (Hegel's self-closing dialectic) to *thought thinking its Other*, and finally to *thought singing its Other*. In this "singing," thought becomes a celebratory, performative, and porous act—an ecstasis that does not seek to possess the other, but to witness it.

This is the language of praise. Thought singing its other is thought that has learned to let beings be, to witness them in their suchness, to participate in their self-manifestation without interference. Lispector's final words in *The Passion According to G.H.* capture this perfectly: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it."[L175] She doesn't comprehend the roach, the neutral, the worse truth—and precisely in that non-comprehension, she can finally sing them.

When we sing deeply through the other, the other starts singing back to us. The tree sings its treeness; in witnessing that without demand, we enable it to sing more fully; and as if in unison, its song then confirms our own existence. An intimacy so alien and yet so near.

## The Agapeic Harvest

The journey that began in aporia and passed through the violence of grace does not end in a static state of enlightenment. It culminates in a new way of being, a new form of love. The ordeal has transformed the very energy that drives us. The restless, hungry desire born of lack—the *penia* of the erotic self—matures into what Desmond calls "agapeic self-transcendence," a going-beyond that arises from "abundance and from gratitude for being as gift."[D43] This transformed state reveals itself in a *fourfold deliverance*, a harvest that finally provides the answer to our question of companionability.

First is the release toward creation. We are delivered to the world, free to behold the other in its astonishing thereness. No longer a thing to be categorized or assimilated, the other is suffered as "unutterably precious."[D43] Desmond speaks of a person confined, beholding a frail spider with a love that keeps faith alive.[D43] This is the perfection of our relationship with the first transcendence (T¹). In this release, the world becomes an inhuman mirror, showing me the matter-of-God that constitutes me. The alien becomes intimate; the foreign reveals itself as home. When I sing the other, I find myself in love, enchanted and chanting.

Second is the release of the abyss within the self. The ordeal does not eliminate our inner darkness, but transforms our relation to it. We have entered into "fearful converse with the monstrous," with our "own gargoyle self." The deliverance comes in "making proper peace with one's gargoyle shadow," an act which "bends the deformed energy into a diviner form."[D43] This is the final metabolization of the murky depths of our self-transcendence (T²). The exiled parts of the self are not vanquished but integrated, their energy reclaimed for a more generous and compassionate being-in-the-world.

This peace with the shadow is not merely psychological but fundamentally *somatic*. The shadow communicates through the body, not limited to our conceptualizations—and thus all the more powerful, all the more monstrous. The body knows what we've exiled before the mind admits it. Tension in the shoulders, nausea in the gut, the clench of the jaw—these are the shadow's language.

Lispector's ordeal is visceral precisely because the shadow cannot be integrated through mental work alone. She must *eat* the roach, must *vomit* the exaltation, must feel the primordial sweat. The transformation requires the body's participation because the shadow *is* partially somatic—the rejected flesh, the despised materiality, the animal self we've tried to transcend.

To embody the shadow means to *become* its integration rather than merely thinking it. The deformed energy, as Desmond says, must be bent into a diviner form—but this bending happens in muscle and nerve and breath, not just in concept. We learn to carry our darkness differently, to let it inform rather than deform us. The monster within becomes the guardian at the threshold, the fierce energy that once threatened us now protecting the vulnerable openness we've achieved.

This integration reveals that the shadow itself is heteronomous—it is constituted not just by what *we* have repressed, but by what *exceeds us* entirely. The shadow includes our animal nature, our mortality, our metabolic dependence on what is not-self. It includes the parts of us that belong to the earth, to evolutionary history, to processes that long preceded our conscious existence and will continue after it. To make peace with the shadow is to accept the body's heteronomy: we are not self-made but co-constituted by forces beyond our control. The work of integration is allowing the mind to catch up to what the flesh has been enacting all along.

Third is the release into a new community, one founded on agapeic service. This reveals a "heteronomy beyond autonomy," a call from the other that is a "welcome rather than a demand."[D43-44] This echoes what Nishitani calls our constitutional emptiness—we are not self-sufficient substances but openings through which being communicates. The call from the other is a call from the field itself, the metaxu/śūnyatā where all genuine service unfolds.

This service, which expects no return, opens the way for the fourth and ultimate deliverance: a release toward the ultimate Other (T³). This is achieved through the most profound paradox: the practice of "counting for nothing." This, Desmond reveals, is the "affirmative double" of the nihilistic void. It is a willing self-emptying that "makes a way for transcendence as other."[D44-45] This is how we become companionable to the irreducible mystery—not by possessing it, but by becoming porous to its passage. This is the absolute poverty that is also the absolute plenitude.

I must confess: I write this not from the summit of achievement but from the midst of the ordeal. The capacity for foreclosure remains. In those moments when my porosity unclogs, I am completely in faith, in absolved trust. I have to confess to myself that I believe in God, because the heteronomy in myself opens to God. That experience comes first, always—the moment when being itself became transparent to its source.

There are times when I can believe, moments of ecstasy where my porosity is restored. The aesthetics of happening become the vehicle—art, music, ritual, love—that inspire in us a connection so powerful it resuscitates our very being back into life. But the cycle continues. I have also forgotten, fallen back, closed off. And therein lies the wound. Therein lies the pain and sorrow.

For how do you relate to divinity once you have experienced it? How do you give that a place in your life when the doors of perception close again? When you have seen what you perhaps should not have seen, and must now live in what feels like its absence? The agapeic harvest is not a permanent state but a fidelity—staying faithful to what you have encountered even through the departures, even when the world loses its luminosity, even when you cannot access what you know to be true. This is *compassio essendi* as wound and as practice: the compassion to remain open to being even when being has withdrawn its overwhelming gift, to sing even when the song falters, to bear witness even in the midst of forgetting. Because what else is there to do when you have been claimed by love, if not to remain faithful to the claim?

This state, this harvest, is best described as *compassio essendi*—a compassion for and with being itself. It is the perfection of the *passio essendi* we first suffered, transformed from a passive undergoing into an active, loving participation. It is a state where thought itself is "surprised by a kind of praying."[D45] In this passionate porosity, we discover that the boundaries have dissolved. A glimpse of a singing *khora*, that primordial receptacle now understood not as a passive container but as an active participant in the cosmic singing. The *metaxu* itself sings, and we discover we have always been part of that song.

The journey ends here, in communion. The vertigo is no longer a disorientation to be overcome but the very rhythm of the "quiet festivity of being." We find our home not by escaping the between, but by discovering our role within it. For the world waits patiently for our participation, and our voice is needed for the chorus to be complete.

# Dark Intelligibility

*"Not dark, just without light"*

## Beyond Witch and Mystic

Initially encountering Clarice Lispector's work, I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, designated with terms like 'dark femininity' or 'witchcraft'. Her friend Otto Lara Resende famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, dangerous, alien. And on the other hand, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'.

I feel an unease with the cultural framing of Lispector as "witch" or "mystic". Even in framing "witch" as an empowering, subversive, counter-dogmatic—this can still reinforce the patriarchal logic of marginalization. Framed as an outsider this could still perpetuate rather than challenge the structures that created exclusion. Beyond that, why subscribe to any binary?

What's at stake in Lispector isn't the romanticization of marginality but something more fundamental: the recognition that authentic encounter with being necessarily exceeds categorical frameworks. Even canonical female mystics like Hildegard, Teresa, or Julian retain their rupturing power not through institutional legitimacy but through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated.

The contemplations of Augustine's *intimior intimo meo*, for example, retain their rupturing power precisely through the vulnerable intimacy of lived experience articulated. When we encounter Teresa's *Interior Castle* or Eckhart's sermons, what moves us isn't their institutional legitimacy but the immediate presence of someone who has been there—the trembling authenticity that no amount of theological framework can fully contain or explain.

What is framed as feminine porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening represents a methodological approach. To be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, our idolization of autonomy.

## The Method of Dark Intelligibility

As introduced in the first chapter, dark intelligibility names understanding that emerges not despite our encounter with the incomprehensible, but precisely through it. It is not the end of reason but its maturation, when knowing learns to dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

**Dark Intelligibility** operates by giving equal weight to the day of reason and the night of mystery. Dark intelligibility becomes a form of non-propositional knowing that requires attunement and fidelity to unknowing. This intelligence doesn't oppose rational thought but reveals its limits—the places where conceptual knowledge must give way to embodied wisdom.

In yoga practice, people often experience somatic releases that are entirely non-rational, sometimes even devoid of conscious content. The body releases what it has been holding without the mind needing to understand what is being released. This points to forms of knowing that operate through **metabolic wisdom**—the body's capacity to process and integrate what exceeds mental comprehension.

Lispector's encounter with the roach demonstrates this dark intelligibility in action. Her body knows before her mind that transformation is occurring: "I was slowly swimming through my oldest primeval soup, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and pabulum vitae, I was being, I was me being." The somatic knowing precedes and exceeds conceptual understanding, teaching consciousness what it needs to know through direct metabolic experience.

## The Thing-Part and Neutral Being

In *The Passion According to G.H.*, Lispector acknowledges something that is already there before all our conceptions of being human: "the inhuman part is the best part of us… the thing-part of us… matter of God, waiting to reclaim me." The inhuman here is not the alienated other, nor the negation of the human. It is nearer to us than our own self-conceptions, nearer than the "self" that thinks it stands apart from the world.

"Why shouldn't I become unclean, exactly as I was discovering my whole self to be?" This question collapses the hierarchy between human and thing, revealing the co-identity of self and non-self, the neutral being in which we participate alongside the roach, the stone, the dust. The "thing-part" is not a degradation but a reclaiming: the intimacy of the impersonal, the suchness of "matter-of-God", the elemental flesh that precedes our personhood.

Lispector's discovery is not without terror: "it was a joy without redemption… a joy without hope." This is joy untethered from any counterfeit double of salvation—no promise of return, no narrative arc to make sense of it. It does not lead elsewhere. And precisely because it is without hope, it is pure: a joy that redeems only by annihilating the need for redemption.

Here the violence of grace becomes visible. The suchness of being overflows our capacity to receive it without trembling. The gift terrifies and attracts because it annihilates the prison in which the self guards its boundaries. It does not flatter our stability; it strips it away.

This is the ground where Dark Intelligibility emerges: the place where the hyperbolic, the intimate, and the impersonal meet. It is not a voiding of intelligibility, but its deepening into a mode that can hold the discomfort of excess—where understanding and un-understanding interpenetrate without resolution. The darkness is not an absence of light but the saturation of it, the light too full to be borne without distortion.

In this register, to encounter being is to be claimed by it, drawn into the impersonal intimacy of suchness, where self and non-self mingle, and the only fidelity is to remain porous—even to what terrifies us.

## Apophasis and Phasis: The Grammar of Limits

In Lispector's work there is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. Perhaps this is what I'm trying to articulate with Dark Intelligibility. As a work on limits we identify the limits, however bright or dark they are, however high or low (hyper - hypo).

Dark intelligibility is not anti-rational thinking but hyperrational—reason stretched to its creative limits, discovering that its deepest success lies not in mastery but in responsive finesse. Lispector's final words capture this: "I am not understanding whatever it is I'm saying, never! never again shall I understand anything I say... And so I adore it."

The adoration that emerges from not-understanding signals intelligence that has learned to think at the edge of thought itself. The saltless truth demands nothing less than transformation of intelligence—from grasping to receiving, from solving to dissolving, from the light that illuminates objects to the darkness that lets being show itself as inexhaustible mystery.

This dark intelligibility suggests that the pharmakon's dual nature—poison/medicine—is determined not only by our metabolic capacity but by our willingness to trust somatic intelligence even when it exceeds rational comprehension. The body often knows how to digest what the mind finds indigestible, but this requires a fundamental attunement to forms of knowing that operate below the threshold of ordinary consciousness.

## Toward Transtheism

I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like transtheism. Eckhart's words "I pray to God to rid me of God". And Nishitani's Sunyata: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness.

I see myself oscillating between Desmond and Nishitani. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. But this oscillation itself passes through an ordeal—the nihilizing process isn't inherently revelatory. It's primarily destructive, an ordeal that must be endured rather than something that directly illuminates. During this dark passage, the only hints of what lies beyond come through counterfeit doubles—seductive mimicries that masquerade as the genuine article—or moments of genuine aesthetic recharge that break through the nihilistic fog, like Lispector's own "without words."

In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is kenosis here, and metanoia. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal.

This letting-be requires what might be called a leap of faith—returning to passio and becoming porous involves leaving the apparent comfort and perceived agency of a conatus-driven self, yielding to a more receptive mode. It means trusting the givenness of being even when that givenness is experienced as too much, too ambiguous, and challenges our flimsy house of cards of meaning-making with a nihilizing kenosis that blows it apart. Beyond the distorted view of an ego-driven conatus, being shows its true nature as gift, as communication, as the porosity Lispector so courageously embodied.

Abba Isaac once said:

> "To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you."

When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling. The falling of the faces.

## The Love Born of Inhuman Intimacy

There is a love borne out of inhuman intimacy, perhaps the love is antecedent to any construction, which is why it is so pure, and why any attachment to the reconfigured ethos frames our connection to primal ethos as a wound. A wound because we know we can do better. Lispector lives within the wound. An unreality that is now the only reality. The paradoxality there is the heart of dark intelligibility.

"Not dark just without light" and without the light of reason we can meet our own being as given, on its own ground. Were we to cast ourselves in the void, not defiantly oppose it with a gaze but to meet the inhuman abyss precisely for what it offers to teach us; cast off identification and liberate yourself. But identification is the comfortable house and habit in which we have lived all our lives.

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. It is here, in the ruins, that astonishment begins again. Dark intelligibility is the method by which we learn to read reality's hyperbolic excess through disciplined attention to what resists comprehension, dwelling companionably with mystery rather than conquering it.

### The Gift and the Ordeal

Being is given to us as a gift, but this gift places us in a condition of fundamental indebtedness. This is not a transactional debt, but a relational one—the [[pharmakon]] of being. It is both medicine and poison, grace and ordeal. Sin, in this frame, can be understood as the **refusal of the gift**—the ego’s turning away from the given in a futile attempt to master being on its own terms.

This is the tension Clarice Lispector confronts with terrifying honesty. She pinpoints it deeply: 

>"How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation ... to being". 

This is the fear of the ordeal that accompanies the gift. I have never seen such [[porosity]] and beauty in the face of this paradox. She confronts the fear, and in doing so, undergoes the violence (or grace) of the indeterminate which disorients the notion of self, putting it in a strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged.

### The Courage of Dark Intelligibility

Dark intelligibility is an idea that came to me in the discussion on Lispector. I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, encountering terms like '[[Dark femininity]]' or '[[Witchcraft]]'. Her friend [[Otto Lara Resende]] famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, alien. Therefore I would like to investigate the feminine aspects of her work, as well as on the flip side, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'. 

The distinction between **canonical mysticism** and **witchcraft** reveals crucial dynamics of institutional capture versus resistance to domestication. Canonical female mystics (Hildegard, Teresa, Julian) have their experiences **incorporated** into established religious frameworks—made "safe" through institutional mediation, their mysticism domesticated within acceptable theological boundaries. The **"witch" figure**, however, represents mystical experience that **refuses institutional mediation**, operating outside or actively challenging established religious and social structures.

On one hand there is a cultural critique to be made by framing lispector's femininity even though her mystical register is beyond categorization. What is framed as feminine is porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening to her, which is her courage. But the "witch" designation captures something more precise: Lispector's **refusal to manage the ferocity** of her encounter. Her writing creates what we might call **contagious porosity**—it doesn't offer catharsis or resolution but **transmits the fear itself**.

The reader encounters not just her description of ontological terror but **participates in it**. As a reader, to be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, our 'reconfigured ethos'.[^1] This is the **pharmakon** of her work—medicine precisely because it's poison.

#### The Witch as Cultural Guardian of Undomesticated Encounter

The witch figure serves as a **cultural guardian** of genuine mystical porosity, maintaining the space of **undomesticated encounter** that institutional religion both needs and fears. While canonical mystics often provide **containers** for spiritual experience, the witch offers **contagious disorganization**—the **infectious quality** that destabilizes others' carefully managed equilibrium.

It is precisely Lispector's own fear —as she articulates her own terror toward being—that makes her so strong. Her courage to face this fear has the capacity to destabilize others, forcing them to look within at the ferocity they wish to manage rather than be porous to. Her strength lies in metabolizing terror without neutralizing it, developing the capacity to bear ontological ferocity while maintaining its **destabilizing potency**.

The witch represents **uncontained transmission** of spiritual intensity—the mystic who refuses to **domesticate their encounter** for others' comfort. They maintain the **raw voltage** of the hyperbolic rather than stepping it down to manageable levels. This explains the cultural need to marginalize such figures: they threaten the **metabolic equilibrium** of systems built on **managed porosity**.

I felt deep intimacy with these 'without words'. In encountering our overdetermined ground, our stabilized frames of the world are challenged. Confronted with an immense vertigo there is a frightening realization. It is frightening precisely because it challenges our stability. I am captivated with her [[apophasis]], aporia, and her courage to face Being fully, even if it means emptying herself. Even if it would make her old self a '[[counterfeit double]]'.

### The "No-sive-Yes" of Disorganization

>"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced -- in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one" here she show aptly intimates the violence of the indeterminate. "as thugh I had lose a third leg that ... kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod. ... And I've gone back to being someone I never was." "Am I disorganized because I have lost something I didn't even need?"  [[Clarice Lispector]]

This is the gesture of "stepping out of the palace," like the Buddha, to encounter the "no" of reality. Lispector's "disorganization" is a **"no-sive-yes"**—a paradoxical affirmation that holds the tension of both yes and no. She says "no" to the stable, three-legged tripod of the ego in order to say a terrifying "yes" to the groundless ground of being. She portrays the arrival at [[the zero point]] and the return back to our [[Reconfigured ethos]], intimately affected by [[the primal ethos]].

### Apophasis and the Great Doubt

There is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like **transtheism**—a philosophical-spiritual position that moves **through** and **beyond** the traditional theism-atheism binary without simply rejecting either term.

**Transtheism** parallels what we might call **non-binary theism**, drawing from the insights of gender studies about how binary categories serve to contain and domesticate what is genuinely transgressive. Just as non-binary gender challenges the entire framework of categorization rather than choosing one side, transtheism transforms the nature of the theological question itself rather than merely selecting "theist" or "atheist."

**Transtheism** is not "neither theist nor atheist" but a **transformed relationship** to the divine that transcends oppositional thinking. The prefix **trans-** indicates having passed **through** both theistic and atheistic questioning, moving **beyond** the limitations of both positions through a fundamental **transformation** of the entire framework. This **resistance to dogmatic appropriation** keeps it alive as what approaches a living universal religion—though even calling it "religion" remains contested terrain.

Like the witch figure, transtheism operates in the space that **resists institutional capture**. It maintains **porosity** to mystery precisely by refusing definitive theological positioning. This is not relativism but **dynamic oscillation**—like oscillating between Nishitani's sunyata and Desmond's agapeic origin without collapsing into synthesis.

[[Eckhart]]'s words "I pray to God to rid me of God" exemplify this movement—using theistic language to point beyond theistic categories. [[Nishitani]]'s Sunyata reveals this same structure: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness, **neither existent nor non-existent**, beyond the is/is not binary.

I see myself oscillating between [[William Desmond|Desmond]] and [[Keiji Nishitani|Nishitani]]. This is the **Great Doubt**, a fire of inquiry born from the groundless ground. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is [[kenosis]] here, and [[metanoia]]. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal.

This oscillation happens in the [[metaxu]]—the between-space where finite and infinite, self and God, participate in creative tension without collapsing into identity. The mystery does not fully disclose itself to be intelligible and exceeds us. **Plenitude equating to emptiness, emptiness to plenitude**—this dynamic tension cannot be resolved into higher synthesis but must be maintained as **creative oscillation**.

Transtheistic consciousness emerges precisely in this metaxu, as a **post-metaphysical spirituality** that operates after the critique of metaphysics while opening space for genuine encounter beyond categorization. The **hyperintelligible** reveals itself precisely through **inexhaustibility**—the mystery discloses itself **as mystery**, not despite its hiddenness but through it.

#### Sacred Atheism and Apophatic Affirmation

Transtheism includes what might be called "sacred atheism"—the **rejection** of idolatrous God-concepts as **protection** of divine mystery from reification. This atheism functions as **purification** rather than elimination, resonating with [[Kenosis]]—the self-emptying that creates space for authentic divine presence.

The **yes** that can only be reached through **no**: this is the **[[No-sive-Yes]]** of apophatic affirmation. Faith that includes and transcends doubt, love that doesn't depend on the beloved's existence, surrender to mystery rather than specific divine will. As Desmond writes about the agapeic response: *"This is the freedom to give oneself up to consummate trust in the intimate companionship of the hidden God."*

### The Three-Tier Structure: Khôra as the Singing Veil

Dark Intelligibility operates within a **three-tier reality structure** that reveals the fundamental architecture of consciousness and being:

**1. The Intelligible Realm** - The domain of determinate, rational, manageable understanding. Here consciousness operates through concepts, categories, and systematic thought. This is the realm of everyday cognition and scientific rationality.

**2. The Hyperintelligible Realm** - Where **participation in divine Nous** occurs. This is Desmond's domain of the hyperintelligible, where consciousness encounters what exceeds determinate forms yet remains necessary for intelligibility itself. Here we participate in what cannot be possessed.

**3. The Unknown** - Pure mystery, absolute excess, the "too muchness" that withdraws even from hyperintelligible encounter. This is the source that reserves itself in ultimate hiddenness.

But between these realms operates the **khôra**—Plato's "third kind" of existence, the **receptive space** that enables transformation and participation without absorption. The khôra is not simply passive receptacle but what we might call **"the veil that sings"**—it simultaneously **veils** the ultimate mystery to protect finite consciousness from overwhelm, while **singing** the call to deeper participation.

#### Khôra as Maternal Matrix: The Pregnant Absence

Following Plato's insight, the khôra functions as **"maternal space"**—the womb-like receptivity that "gives place" for being without itself being reducible to being or non-being. As Derrida recognizes, it represents a "radical otherness" that defies traditional logical categorization—"neither present nor absent, active or passive."

This maternal dimension resonates profoundly with **Nishitani's development of sunyata** as the **interpenetration of all things**. Emptiness here is not mere void but **pregnant absence**—a dynamic nothingness that is inseparable from being itself. As Nishitani shows, nothingness and being are in **dynamic relation** because they ultimately **intimate** each other. This points toward what we might call the **necessity for there to be something rather than nothing**—not as logical requirement but as the **creative tension** that holds reality in being.

**Nishida's concept of basho** (place/field) further illuminates this structure. The basho is not a container that holds contents but the **absolute nothingness** that allows all determination to appear. Like the khôra, it is the **"place of places"** that cannot itself be placed—the field that makes all fields possible while remaining **fieldless** itself.

In the context of Dark Intelligibility, the khôra becomes the **space of metabolic processing**—the maternal matrix where the excessive dosis of being is received, digested, and transformed into forms that finite consciousness can bear. But this processing happens through **interpenetration** rather than separation. The khôra doesn't **contain** the transformation but **is** the transformation as the **dynamic relationship** between finite and infinite, determinate and overdeterminate.

This pregnant absence explains why the khôra can simultaneously **veil and sing**—it is the **creative tension** between hiddenness and revelation, the **dynamic emptiness** that births meaning while remaining **meaningless** itself.

#### The Singing Dimension

But the khôra is not merely passive receptivity. In the singing veil, we encounter what Julia Kristeva calls the space "between semiotic and symbolic realms"—a **melodic dimension** that calls consciousness beyond its current configurations. The veil sings because the khôra is **dynamically responsive** to both the hyperintelligible pressure from above and the finite receptivity from below.

This singing manifests in multiple forms:
- **Dreams and visions** that prepare consciousness for greater openings
- **Aesthetic experiences** that crack open ordinary perception
- **Synchronicities** that reveal deeper patterns of meaning
- **Contemplative states** where the boundary between self and world becomes porous

The khôra thus serves as both **protection** and **invitation**—shielding consciousness from premature exposure to the hyperbolic while maintaining the call to transformation. It is the **space of finesse** where Dark Intelligibility actually operates.

Abba Isaac once said:

> “To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you.”

When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling. The falling of the faces.

In one of my dreams I made such an image. It was a face, or the emptiness of a face, enshrined in a veil. My mind had given me an enshrined face to hold what was too intense, too difficult to conceive, protecting me from overwhelm. The dropping of the face is becoming ready to receive what's shining in the fissures. It is the move from a fixed point on a disc to its radial, **[[hyperbolic dimension]]**, where we dissolve into the whole of ourselves and the whole of the universe.

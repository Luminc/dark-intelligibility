### The Gift and the Ordeal

Being is given to us as a gift, but this gift places us in a condition of fundamental indebtedness. This is not a transactional debt, but a relational one—the [[pharmakon]] of being. It is both medicine and poison, grace and ordeal. Sin, in this frame, can be understood as the **refusal of the gift**—the ego’s turning away from the given in a futile attempt to master being on its own terms.

This is the tension Clarice Lispector confronts with terrifying honesty. She pinpoints it deeply: 

>"How do I explain that my greatest fear is precisely in relation ... to being". 

This is the fear of the ordeal that accompanies the gift. I have never seen such [[porosity]] and beauty in the face of this paradox. She confronts the fear, and in doing so, undergoes the violence (or grace) of the indeterminate which disorients the notion of self, putting it in a strata between the finite and infinite where all our constructs of the world are deeply challenged.

### The Courage of Dark Intelligibility

Dark intelligibility is an idea that came to me in the discussion on Lispector. I was fascinated by the cultural framing of her work, encountering terms like '[[Dark femininity]]' or '[[Witchcraft]]'. Her friend [[Otto Lara Resende]] famously warned: this is not literature but witchcraft. While this attests to the profound affect of her work, there is also the complex gendered and cultural weight of the witch or the feminine as inherently chaotic, alien. Therefore I would like to investigate the feminine aspects of her work, as well as on the flip side, the notion of the 'mystic', even the 'saint'. 

On one hand there is a cultural critique to be made by framing lispector's femininity even though her mystical register is beyond categorization. What is framed as feminine is porosity and radical transparency to what is frightening to her, which is her courage. It becomes witchcraft perhaps through the fact that it is esoteric. In that, in the frame of the religious, it is erupting as a private, secret exercise. As a reader, to be transformed by her writing is to yourself become porous to affects you have intimated before but could not bear the full light of. When reaching such powerful registers, we ourselves can become frightened as it challenges our own stable selves, our 'reconfigured ethos'.

[[Derrida]] through [[Cixous]]: a writing of the 'limit' --- [[aporia]], unsaying, [[feminine messianicity]]

I felt deep intimacy with these 'without words'. In encountering our overdetermined ground, our stabilized frames of the world are challenged. Confronted with an immense vertigo there is a frightening realization. It is frightening precisely because it challenges our stability. I am captivated with her [[apophasis]], aporia, and her courage to face Being fully, even if it means emptying herself. Even if it would make her old self a '[[counterfeit double]]'.

### The "No-sive-Yes" of Disorganization

>"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced -- in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one" here she show aptly intimates the violence of the indeterminate. "as thugh I had lose a third leg that ... kept me from walking but made me a stable tripod. ... And I've gone back to being someone I never was." "Am I disorganized because I have lost something I didn't even need?"  [[Clarice Lispector]]

This is the gesture of "stepping out of the palace," like the Buddha, to encounter the "no" of reality. Lispector's "disorganization" is a **"no-sive-yes"**—a paradoxical affirmation that holds the tension of both yes and no. She says "no" to the stable, three-legged tripod of the ego in order to say a terrifying "yes" to the groundless ground of being. She portrays the arrival at [[the zero point]] and the return back to our [[Reconfigured ethos]], intimately affected by [[the primal ethos]].

### Apophasis and the Great Doubt

There is the tension with apophasis and phasis. They seem deeply entangled with one another. Pure apophasis is impossible, as every negation carries the trace of what it negates. I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like transtheism. [[Eckhart]]'s words "I pray to God to rid me of God". And [[Nishitani]]'s Sunyata: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness. 

I see myself oscillating between [[William Desmond|Desmond]] and [[Keiji Nishitani|Nishitani]]. This is the **Great Doubt**, a fire of inquiry born from the groundless ground. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is [[kenosis]] here, and [[metanoia]]. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal.

This oscillation happens in the [[metaxu]]—the between-space where finite and infinite, self and God, participate in creative tension without collapsing into identity.

Abba Isaac once said:

> “To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you.”

When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling. The falling of the faces.

In one of my dreams I made such an image. It was a face, or the emptiness of a face, enshrined in a veil. My mind had given me an enshrined face to hold what was too intense, too difficult to conceive, protecting me from overwhelm. The dropping of the face is becoming ready to receive what's shining in the fissures. It is the move from a fixed point on a disc to its radial, **[[hyperbolic dimension]]**, where we dissolve into the whole of ourselves and the whole of the universe.

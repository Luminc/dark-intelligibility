## Poros-Sive-Penia: The Restlessness of Shared Groundlessness

The neutral ground is not inert. It's alive with our restlessness. Lispector affirms this: "do not be afraid of neediness: it is our greater destiny."[L179] Neediness is our very structure in the midst of things. "Love is as inherent as wanting itself," she continues, "and we are guaranteed by a necessity that shall renew itself continuously. Love already is, it is always. All that is missing is the coup de grâce—which is called passion."[L179]

Here Lispector distinguishes between the ontological and the existential: *love already is*—this is the passio essendi, our given-ness, our being-as-received. But passion—the explicit consent, the existential yes—this arrives as event, as the coup de grâce that awakens us to what we already ontologically are. We are constitutively needy, but we must come to know this neediness, to consent to it, to let it transform from blockage to opening.

Her neediness can be connected to *penia*, poverty, lack, the emptiness that drives beyond itself. In Plato's *Symposium*, Eros is born from the coupling of Poros (resource, passage, way) and Penia (poverty, lack, need). But this is no mere allegory. The structure of desire reveals the structure of being itself. Desmond's meditation on poros and penia in "The Erotics of the Intimate Universal" helps us think through how these seemingly opposed terms interpenetrate.^[Desmond frames his discussion with two saturated mythic images from classical sources. First, the Bull of Phalaris: Perilaus the sculptor constructs a bronze bull as torture device where reed pipes transform prisoners' screams into "sweet music"—beauty serving tyranny, art prostituted for power, eros mechanizing suffering. Second, the Singing Cicadas from Plato's *Phaedrus*: men so ravished by the Muses' gift of music that they forgot food and drink, dying of too much song, reborn as cicadas to eternally witness those who truly live in philosophy. The contrast reveals two ways of being at the *metaxu*: *eros turannos* (tyrannical desire that controls and closes) versus *eros ouranios* (heavenly desire that reopens porosity even in hell, like Orpheus's music)[Di311-315]]

Penia is not mere absence. Lispector articulates its paradoxical power: "The great emptiness in me shall be my place for existing; my extreme poverty shall be a great volition."[L158-159] The lack is not passive—it is *active*, generative, volitional. The emptiness is not what must be filled but the very space that allows existing. "My demand is my size," she writes, "my emptiness is my measure."[L158-159]

This is the first move in understanding poros-sive-penia: *poverty is not privation but opening*. The lack is simultaneously the capacity. The neediness is the ground of volition itself.

But what of poros? If penia is dynamic emptiness, active lack, what is the passage? Desmond helps us here. *Poros* has connotations of "a way across," he notes—with no way across or through, we find ourselves at an impasse, an aporia. But poros is not straightforward passage. It names "a transition that is no transition, since in making a way, it makes way and hence there is a withdrawal in the very opening of the way."[D41]

The way opens *by withdrawing*. The passage creates space through its own recession. This is not poros as determinate resource (this path, that capacity) but poros as *kenotic opening*—the self-emptying that makes room for the other. Like penia, poros too participates in emptiness. The passage is achieved not by filling space but by hollowing it out.

Now the paradox deepens. Both penia and poros involve emptiness. Penia: the lack that hungers, the poverty that reaches outward. Poros: the opening that receives, the passage that withdraws inward

They are not opposites but *complementary movements of the same groundlessness*. The lack seeks passage; the passage opens to lack. Neither is foundational. Both arise from—and return to—the shared emptiness, the neutral, the original part.

Lispector articulates their interpenetration viscerally: "Needing never ends since needing is inherent to my neutral."[L187-188] The neediness is not separable from the neutral ground—it is *inherent* to it. The groundlessness is itself restless. And this restlessness is not accidental but constitutional. "Whatever I do with the plea and the want—that will be the life I will have made from my life."[L188-189]

Life is not what happens after we overcome the plea and want. Life *is* what we make from the neediness itself. This is metaxological existence: not escaping the between but learning to dwell there, to move within the tension of penia and poros, poverty and passage, hunger and opening.

The hyphen in *poros-sive-penia* is crucial. Not "poros or penia" (as if we must choose). Not even "poros and penia" (as if they are separate terms we combine). But *poros-sive-penia*: the intimacy between them, the radical interpenetration where each is the condition for the other's manifestation. The lack needs passage; the passage requires lack. The hunger opens; the opening hungers.

This structure parallels other *sive* formulations we find across traditions. Nishitani's articulation of the Heart Sutra: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form"—not two different things but *form-sive-emptiness*, the radical non-duality where each manifests through the other. Lispector will later discover *life-sive-death* in eating the roach, both fully present without synthesis. The *sive* names not identity but interpenetration, not collapse but mutual constitution.

## Aporia: When Blockage Becomes Passage

This structure of poros-sive-penia illuminates a deeper understanding of *aporia*—literally "without passage" or "waylessness." Traditionally understood as productive philosophical impasse, aporia reveals something more paradoxical when viewed through the lens of poros-sive-penia. It is not simply blockage that clears space for new thinking. It is blockage that *contains* passage within itself.

The impasse is not the opposite of passage but its secret intensity. When poros withdraws, when the way recedes, we experience aporia—no way forward, no path visible. But this very blockage, if we can remain porous to it rather than flee from it, becomes the site where new passages open. The dead-end, metabolized rather than resisted, reveals itself as threshold.

This is the double nature of aporia itself: blockage *and* breakthrough, simultaneously. The janus face of impediment and emergence. What appears as obstacle to our daylight consciousness reveals itself, to nocturnal awareness, as the very condition for transformation. The way opens precisely through its recession. Passage emerges from within impasse.

Lispector demonstrates this metabolic relationship to blockage: "Not putting oneself in view of hope is not the destruction of the plea! and is not abstaining from neediness. Ah, it's by increasing it, it's by infinitely increasing the plea that is born of neediness."[L189-192] The move is not to overcome the blockage (which would be fleeing aporia) but to *intensify* it, to go deeper into the impasse itself. In this intensification, something transforms. The plea does not diminish, it increases, and in that deepening of neediness, passage opens.

This is aporia as *metabolic ordeal*. We cannot think our way through it. We cannot strategize past it. We can only undergo it, remaining porous to what it demands of us. The blockage has its own communication. But it teaches only those willing to dwell in not-knowing, to let the impasse work on them until it reveals its hidden porosity.

## Eros: The Restlessness Between

If poros-sive-penia names the structure, what is the activity? What moves between poverty and passage? The tradition names it clearly: *Eros*, desire, the child born of penia and poros. But Eros is not a third thing added to poverty and passage. Eros *is* their interpenetration made manifest. Eros is the restlessness itself.

This restlessness is strung across the abyss of emptiness. It is not grounded in fullness but suspended between lack and opening, poverty and passage. Eros ripples on the dynamics of poros and penia, drawing from their shared groundlessness. We are not troubled *by* desire—we *are* the trouble, the restlessness itself, the vibration between emptiness that hungers and emptiness that opens.

Desmond speaks of being at the *metaxu* as perpetual between-being, where we are constituted precisely in the space of relation. Eros emerges in this between. Not by learning to move within it, to balance the two movements, to let them work in tandem.

There are two modes of erotic movement, each drawing from one pole:

*Poros-eros*: kenotic receptivity, the opening that makes space for what comes. This is the eros that receives, that empties itself to allow the other to emerge. It draws from poros's recessive passage, its withdrawn opening. This is not passivity but patient porosity—the active work of remaining open, of not foreclosing through grasping.

*Penia-eros*: hungry reaching, the lack that drives outward toward what it needs. This is the eros that seeks, that pursues, that cannot remain static. It draws from penia's restless energy, its inability to be satisfied with mere absence. This is not grasping but genuine longing—the vitality of need that prevents us from closing into false completion.

Both are necessary. Without poros-eros, penia-eros becomes *eros turannos*—tyrannical desire that must possess, control, dominate. The hunger without opening becomes violence. Without penia-eros, poros-eros becomes formless dissolution—the opening without energy collapses into passive receptivity that cannot stand, cannot act, cannot participate. The passage without hunger loses its vitality.

The wisdom lies in their *tandem*, their skilled orchestration. Like Plato's charioteer in *Phaedrus* who must guide two horses—one noble, one base—both necessary for the soul's ascent. The ascent is not achieved by killing the base horse (the hunger) but by learning to guide both together, to let their different energies work in concert toward what exceeds them both.

This tandem movement prevents either pole from becoming counterfeit. The kenotic opening is tempered by hunger's vitality; the hungry reaching is tempered by opening's receptivity. Each checks the other's potential for distortion. Together they create what Lispector calls "a love full of fury"[L158-159]—love that includes both the gentleness of receptivity and the intensity of need, both the patience of opening and the urgency of hunger.

This is metaxological desire: desire that has learned to dwell in the between without collapsing it, that can hold the tension of poros-sive-penia without fleeing into false resolutions. It is desire aware of its own groundlessness, consenting to the restlessness as fundamental rather than provisional.

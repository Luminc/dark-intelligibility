## The Energy of Eros Transformed

Having undergone the ordeal, having discovered ourselves as poros-sive-penia, we now understand differently the energy that moves us. We are not simply troubled by desire—we *are* the trouble, the restlessness strung across the abyss between having and not-having. But now this restlessness has been metabolized, transformed from blind compulsion into conscious participation.

The wisdom lies not in resolving the tension between penia and poros but in orchestrating their tandem movement. The kenotic opening is tempered by hunger's vitality; the hungry reaching is tempered by opening's receptivity. Each checks the other's potential for distortion. Together they create what Lispector calls "a love full of fury"[L158-159]—love that includes both the gentleness of receptivity and the intensity of need.

This is metaxological desire that has matured into agapeic love: desire that has learned to dwell in the between without collapsing it, that can hold the tension without fleeing into false resolutions. It is desire aware of its own groundlessness, consenting to the restlessness as fundamental rather than provisional, yet finding in this very restlessness the energy for generous giving.

## Union-in-Difference: The Harvest

The ultimate harvest of this transformation is a new way of loving that resolves a beautiful paradox. On one hand, Desmond's God gives an asymmetrical, unreturnable gift of being—a gift so total that it is "foreign... to our (all too erotic) conceptual economies"[PU195]. We can never repay it. On the other hand, the transformed experience is one of profound reciprocity: being "confirmed by all things."

The resolution is the heart of the matter: our "singing back," our act of confirming the other, is not an attempt to repay the gift. It is the most complete and profound way of receiving it. Because the gift was that we be "freely released into being for ourselves"[D257], we honor that freedom most fully by becoming free givers in our turn. We receive the gift of being by participating in the ongoing act of creation.

This act of grateful, reciprocal loving is a finite participation in the infinite Agapeic Origin. Our achieved agapeic love is a creaturely echo of God's primordial "letting the other be." This is the meaning of *union-in-difference*. We remain finite creatures, receivers of the gift (the difference), yet we are brought into conscious, loving communion with the divine source through our own acts of giving (the union).

The heteronomy we feared—possession by the other—reveals itself as the call of our own deepest being. What seemed alien intrusion is our original participation. We are not dissolved but discovered, not possessed but released into our truest selfhood—one that sings with rather than against the world.

Desmond's 'absolved relativity' names what we achieve through dark intelligibility: relation freed from the demand to possess or be possessed. We are absolved—released—into genuine togetherness. Not dissolved into unity, not scattered into isolation, but held in the between where genuine selves can sing to genuine others. This is relation transfigured by agapeic generosity: each term released to be itself precisely through its openness to the other.

The hopeless joy we discovered is the emotional register of this absolved relativity. Joy without hope because it needs no future completion—it is already complete in its incompletion, already whole in its openness. We are absolved of the need to mean something beyond this singing, this festivity of being-between.

When I sing the other, I find myself in love. Enchanted and chanting. The boundaries dissolve. The world becomes an inhuman mirror, showing me the matter-of-God that constitutes me. The alien becomes intimate; the foreign reveals itself as home. I long to sleep under the moss, to become compost under a thick blanket of dew, to participate in the slow, silent festivity. A glimpse of a singing khora, that primordial receptacle now understood not as passive container but as active participant in the cosmic singing. The metaxu itself sings, and when we have learned to listen, we discover we have always been part of that song, and that our voice is needed for the chorus to be complete, that the world waits patiently for our participation in its self-manifestation.

## Departure, Arrival, Return

Dark intelligibility is not a destination but a movement—an oscillating rhythm between departure, arrival, and return that constitutes the metabolic practice of being in the metaxu. This is not a linear progression from ignorance to enlightenment, but a cycle that honors all directions as necessary dimensions of the same lived truth.

We are always already in motion—departure, arrival, return—and fidelity to flux means consenting to this rhythm rather than trying to arrest it at any single point. But this consent is not passive acceptance. It is sustained attention in the face of inevitable reterritorialization, inevitable forgetting. After the experience comes amnesis—the fading of the revelation, the return to ordinary consciousness. Yet something remains: not the peak experience but the metabolic capacity developed through it.

The practice is learning to trust this cycle, to know that departure will come again, that the ordinary contains the seeds of the extraordinary, that even our forgetting participates in a larger remembering. This is what it means to become companionable rather than possessed—to learn the rhythm of approach and withdrawal, presence and absence, revelation and concealment.

## Courage, Connection, Participation

Courage, participation, connection—this is what agapeic love asks of us. The courage to remain open to what exceeds us. The participation in creation that happens when we stop imposing and start witnessing. The connection to self and world that reveals itself when we discover these are not separate domains but interpenetrating dimensions of the same original part.

"The quiet festivity of agapeic of being"[D164]—an intimate joy in us participating in creation, a mutual bringing-forth of reality. This is the Great Affirmation in its lived reality: not abstract yes to being, but intimate participation in being's festivity. The metabolic transformation that began in ordeal, that passed through the ruins of meaning and the terror of the neutral, arrives finally at this: we learn to sing, and in singing, we are sung. We find our resting place not by escaping the between but by discovering the between as home, the metaxu as the very ground of wholeness.

Dark intelligibility and agapeic love are not separate achievements but two dimensions of the same transformation: a way of knowing that is simultaneously a way of loving, a receptivity that is simultaneously an affirmation, a vulnerability that is simultaneously a strength. This is the fruit of the ordeal, the harvest of metabolic development, the gift that was always already present in the pharmakon we feared would destroy us.

## Toward Ontological Nutrition

This entire framework suggests that spiritual traditions might be understood as sophisticated technologies for *metabolic development*—systematic training programs for consciousness to expand its digestive range, to learn to find sustenance in what initially appears as pure poison or meaninglessness. Maturation becomes precisely this expansion of metabolic range: learning to digest stronger and stronger doses of unsalted reality until we can finally subsist on being itself without the mediating supplements of human meaning-making.

The roach encounter becomes a genuine philosophical experiment in *ontological nutrition*—testing whether human consciousness can learn to subsist on unsalted being, to find sustenance in neutrality itself. Can we develop the metabolic capacity to break our chrysalis ourselves, to undergo the necessary decomposition that allows genuine transformation rather than mere reformation?

A new form of knowing occurs: our unknowing-sive-knowing. A knowing that is closer to a kind of touching, an encounter contact with the divine that feels as a confirmation of ourselves with God. Being becomes communion. Being at that state is a pure nakedness before God. And after everything is burned away what remains is an entry into the palace in a union-in-difference. Our neediness is replaced with peace. We are already forgiven.

## Coda: The Question of Companionability

The journey that began by asking how we might become companionable to what threatens to possess us finds its answer here. Agapeic love is the name for that perfected companionability—a way of being with the other that is intimate without consuming, and porous without being destroyed.

Companionability is still also a question for the questioning of autonomy versus heteronomy. Is there a point at which autonomy as we know it collapses? In the text, there is a deeper selfhood that emerges in non-duality. But as the cycle of departure-arrival-return reveals, our "arrival" is one part of the pendulum swing and the amnesis from the "return" challenges us to remain at the metaxu. On the one hand, we do not want to constantly be exposed to excess, we couldn't go on living. Yet simultaneously we do not want to lose touch with overdeterminacy. This is the kind of ongoing practice that never stops. Walking the thin line between eros turannos and ouranios, between self and other, between the finite and infinite.

The question, then, was never how to avoid the ordeal, but how to bear it. We learn not through mastery, but through metabolization. We learn to receive the "superplus" of being by becoming porous enough not to be shattered by its grace. We learn to find nourishment in the very shadow of our nothingness, to discover that the pharmakon's poison, when fully tasted, is the medicine.

The journey that began in a "sweet and abysmal vertigo"[L29] does not end in certainty. It ends in communion. The vertigo is no longer a disorientation to be overcome, but the very rhythm of the "quiet festivity of being." We find our home not by escaping the between, but by learning to sing in it.

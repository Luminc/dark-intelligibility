# The Rule of the Other: Companionability and Possession

*"I really like things I don't understand. When I read a thing I don't understand, I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo."*
—Clarice Lispector, *A Breath of Life*, p. 29

I should disorganize, and yet structure simultaneously. I should create meta-structures that can kiss disorganization here and there. 

I love the pen. I'm too disconnected from the physical process of writing. There is a different flow when you actually draw the words.

What has language done for me, for better and worse? Or perhaps more precisely: **How does the determined become companionable to indeterminacy?** How do light and dark conjoin in chiaroscuro?

Today, in a world where ambiguity dominates and social cohesion evaporates, too much meaning exists—univocal, equivocal, or otherwise. What draws our focus is the ever-present stage of self-determination, the human spectacle. We can see that there are real limits to that self-determination. Being is communicative, but it is inseparable from non-being. I seem to be spinning around dualities again. There is an urgency for us to become intimate to their conjunctions and interpenetrations. However, the demands of life hijack our capacity to open to them. Let us stop making sense for a moment and try to delve deeper.

## The Rule of the Other

Words do not come easy at times, so we let them be. It is natural not to know the way, so we should become lost. If there is one thing clear I can say about myself, it is that I'm lost. I find things, things happen to me, but I am groundless, like a cell breaking open, its contents spilling out. Disorganization can be messy.

How can I write without knowing where to go? I shall have somebody else write through me. Starting with my parental voices, Clarice Lispector and William Desmond.

Heteronomy is the intrusion autonomy tries to prevent. Just think of the ongoing immigration panic. We encounter the other, framed as an intrusion.  If it's not capable of being dominated, at least made manageable. We foreclose true encounter with the other, but the relations remain and with it the potential for another intrusion.

The other intrudes in myself as well. In my voice, my very being, there is a whole host of voices speaking through me. It is certainly astonishing that we, such porous interconnected beings, think of ourselves as autonomous. At any given moment I am possessed by voices not my own.

*Cum panis* indeed. Following Desmond's sense of the open whole, do we arrive at a liberated autonomy? An autonomy that knows itself to at least be plurivocal and connected to others?

## The Scandal of Reality

"I only use reason as an anesthetic" (p. 36)

"As a scandal" (p. 36)

The scandal of reality is connected to the idiocy—the sheer *that it is*—the ambiguity. The scandal highlights the flip side of the miracle. It contains its controversial, secretive, difficult to reconcile. Truly, reality as happening is astonishing and excessive. Hence the designation as scandal.

"I too must have turned down a dead end alley, just like the others." (p. 36)

The author in *Breath of Life* seems to manage and edit Angela:

"I control her as much as I can, deleting her merely foolish comments." (p. 39)

This positions them in a plurivocal relationship with autonomy dispersed. A chaotic Angela is edited by the author, allowed to come into existence on her own terms, but relational, confined to a post-hoc past of the author in a different modality.

"Traveling through this book while keeping Angela company is tricky." (p. 39)

"I'd like to cure her of herself. But her sickness is stronger than my powers." (p. 42)

"From now on I want more than understanding. I want super understanding. [...] I want to reach the most intimate secret of whatever exists." (p. 42)

This seems like hubris, but super understanding and reaching secrets do not imply that the secret is unlocked. Maybe only intimately acknowledged.

## Drawing Words

To return briefly to the chiaroscuro: a beautiful word, for I used to draw too, and writing is an extension of drawing. The mediaticity of writing physically is its own medium. I have drawn on tablets and made beautiful life drawings but they remain digital files.

If we consider writing the techno-pharmakon par excellence then of course we cannot underestimate the power of a trembling hand furtively scribbling thoughts to the page as if the line was its very consciousness.

Sweet and abysmal because, hell, we have no idea and we still want to sit with the question. Companionable to the question.

Breath, dissolution, structure, should be part of writing. Words should be able to breathe. We can run into blockages and aporia and what do we do? Give up? Hunt further?

Or let it breathe?

Aporia is companionable to the going, sweetly abysmal as it is.

## On Possession and Freedom

My desire for possession comes not from a desire for self-dissolution but for recognizing interdependence and flowing in the river. What freedom would that give? It could be radical.

The body writes and has written for a few thousand years, enough for it to be a new page in our evolutionary techgnosis. Quickly it is being abandoned for the keyboard and the screen. Command line interfaces.

While there are ways of exaptation and we are of course fluid beings in becoming, I do still like physical writing. Perhaps precisely because it is a form of drawing.

## The Triangle

Today it felt urgent to work but it also felt urgent to disorganize.

I was playful in letting Lispector and Desmond together with me make us into a triangle. Geometric stability through threeness, yet each point remains irreducible. Not synthesis but constellation.

Both Desmond and Clarice are enactive of what they write about. It is a lived philosophy after all. Porosity requires that intimacy, that vulnerability of expression in the midst of things. I want to get to the threshold of both thinkers.

The body writes. There is a restlessness there. This disorganization felt urgent, and it worked. But the danger is tying disorganization and productivity to any external means, lest we become too dependent. We are not independent—we allow heteronomy to affect our writing as well.

However, this disorganization and productivity is dangerous to be tied to any single source. Since I am not independent, I flow with the interdependence. But I must remain vigilant.

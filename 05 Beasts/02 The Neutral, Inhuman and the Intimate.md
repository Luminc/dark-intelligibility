### Porosity and the Neutral

"The World had always been humanized. Now I was before the inhuman. The neutral was what was intimate."[^1] Clarice Lispector's narrator in The Passion According to G.H. encounters an intimacy that is not warm, not consoling, but alien. Intimacy here is not the communion of similarity, but the piercing proximity of otherness. There is an otherness to selving. The cockroach, that abject creature, tears through the membrane of her constructed self. She confronts what she calls "the great living neutrality struggling",[^2]life stripped of its human face, vitality indifferent to meaning.

William Desmond offers a striking parallel in his book the God and the Between: "The idiocy of being is the sheer astonishment that there is anything at all, its intimate givenness and its foreign neutrality."[^3] What Lispector calls the neutral, Desmond refers to as the primal ethos: the bare fact of being before any determination, given to us before we come to be in a double register — as strangely intimate and irreducibly foreign.

Both writers refuse the hard split of subject and object. For Lispector, the self is undone by what leaks through from within and without. For Desmond, the self always arises at the _metaxu_, the between, the self and other always constantly co-determining. The key point is not merely that the world resists humanization, but that the self too harbors alterity. To be porous to the other is to be porous to oneself. Selving is not a closed autonomy but an openness where alterity can shine through.

When the constructions of self break down, something else emerges — the fertile neutrality of being. What is neutral is not dead; it is generative precisely in its refusal to conform to categories. This fertility is terrifying because it loosens the boundaries of identity. Yet it is also the beginning of intimacy — a strange intimacy with the inhuman in ourselves.

## The Thing-Part and Neutral Being

Something in us is already there before all our conceptions of being human: "the inhuman part is the best part of us… the thing-part of us… matter of God, waiting to reclaim me." The inhuman here is not the alienated other, nor the negation of the human. It is nearer to us than our own self-conceptions, nearer than the "self" that thinks it stands apart from the world.

"Why shouldn't I become unclean, exactly as I was discovering my whole self to be?" This question collapses the hierarchy between human and thing, revealing the co-identity of self and non-self, the neutral being in which we participate alongside the roach, the stone, the dust. The "thing-part" is not a degradation but a reclaiming: the intimacy of the impersonal, the suchness of "matter-of-God", the elemental flesh that precedes our personhood.

Lispector's discovery is not without terror: "it was a joy without redemption… a joy without hope." This is joy untethered from any counterfeit double of salvation—no promise of return, no narrative arc to make sense of it. It does not lead elsewhere. And precisely because it is without hope, it is pure: a joy that redeems only by annihilating the need for redemption.

Here the violence of grace becomes visible. The excess of being overflows our capacity to receive it without trembling. The gift terrifies and attracts because it annihilates the prison in which the self guards its boundaries. It does not flatter our stability; it strips it away.

In this register, to encounter being is to be claimed by it, drawn into the impersonal intimacy of suchness, where self and non-self mingle, and the only fidelity is to remain porous—even to what terrifies us. But what is the actual substance of this terrifying, neutral reality? And what is the nature of the ordeal required to metabolize it?

### The Saltless Truth and the Pharmakon

Lispector locates the ordeal with a striking metaphor: "For salt I had always been ready, salt was the transcendence that I used to experience a taste, and to flee what I was calling 'nothing.' But what my mouth wouldn't know how to understand—was the saltless."[^4] The salt becomes our filters and constructions, our limited self-determination which ultimately forecloses our direct encounter with being's naked actuality.

Desmond frames the same ordeal as the tension between _conatus essendi_ and _passio essendi_: "We are given to be before we give ourselves to be. There is a passio essendi, a patience of being, more primordial than our conatus essendi, our endeavor to be."[^5] Conatus is our striving, our effort to preserve and assert selfhood, keeping reality in a digestible order. Passio is our given-ness, the raw unmediated encounter of being.

Being at this level can be seen as a _pharmakon_. The pharmakon reaches us through a philosophical lineage that reveals its metaxological character. In Plato's _Phaedrus_, King Thamus warns that writing—Thoth's gift to humanity—will be both remedy and poison for memory: strengthening external recall while weakening the soul's internal capacity for recollection. Bernard Stiegler extends this insight in his technopharmacology, showing how technical objects are constitutive of human becoming itself—we co-evolve with our tools in what is fundamentally a metaxological relationship. Technology is neither external instrument nor internal capacity but the very between-space where human and world co-determine each other.

The **Pharmakon of Being** I'm proposing operates at this same constitutive level, but more fundamentally still. Where Derrida's pharmakon reveals the undecidability of conceptual oppositions, and Stiegler's technopharmacology shows the co-constitutive relationship between human and technical objects, the Pharmakon of Being concerns our metabolic encounter with existence itself. This concerns the ordeal of existence: whether we can bear being's gift without being destroyed by its excess.

Desmond hints at this metabolic dimension: "We clot on ourselves again and close the porosity. The blood stream of life is made the carrier of death."[^6] The same encounter with being's overdeterminate richness can either open us to deeper community or close us off into "counterfeit doubles" of authentic transcendence.

Lispector embodies this viscerally. The roach's white matter becomes literal pharmakon—she must eat it to receive its truth, knowing it may poison her old self even as it nourishes new understanding. The "anti-sin" she discovers is precisely this willingness to metabolize reality rather than flee into transcendent abstractions. This is the metaxological courage to remain in the between rather than escape to false unities.

The ambiguity is fundamental. There is only so much indeterminate grace we can bear. Can we come to terms with our own strangeness? As the self protests, calcified by its own understanding, can we let the world collapse and come to trembling uncertainty? It will certainly require courage.

### The Violence of Grace

"I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to ground myself in what I experienced—in that grounding I would lose the world as it was for me before, and I know I don't have the capacity for another one."[^7]

Grace is not orderly illumination but a tearing apart of structures. After collapse we live among ruins: the ruins of our meaning, the ruins of our selves. We would like to return to the familiar middle, to salt and season what we once knew. But could we fool ourselves? The collapse cannot be undone.

The violence of grace occurs when we encounter what exceeds us, placing us in the strata between finite and infinite where our constructs are shattered. In Lispector’s _G.H._, the brutality of grace is unflinching: the protagonist is violently unseated by an encounter that kills her narcissistic certainties even as it births strange compassion. There is no gentle pedagogy — grace strikes like a knife. The violence is felt because grace collapses the ‘familiar middle,’ the counterfeit refuge built by conatus, and forces us back into astonishment

And yet something in us consents. There is a blurring of heteronomy and autonomy: ordeal comes from outside, yet it is also our own doing. We say yes to being transformed, even as this yes undoes us. As Desmond notes, the new astonishment is a gratitude "won from suffering; a 'yes' purged of complaint; an affirmation that has wept, as there is a mourning that is blessed."[^8]

This is what Lispector calls "the worse truth"[^9] — horrible because it confronts the totality: the yes and the no, the beautiful and the horrific, the gift and the ordeal together. It is the pharmakon of being: a medicine that heals us by poisoning us, an excess that disorganizes us to reorient us.

The paradox is stark. Ordeal comes as heteronomy, as Rilke's command _"You must change your life."_[^10] But it also demands our autonomy, our willingness to undergo. It is a participatory surrender, a choice that is also not a choice. For what if we refuse? The pharmakon of being cannot be avoided; it can only be received, consciously or unconsciously. The question is whether we can metabolize reality, or whether we are metabolized by our refusal.

### The Fruit of the Ordeal: A New Knowing, A New Love

To affirm suchness without narrative, to receive the pharmakon without fleeing—this is the intimacy with the inhuman, the fertile neutrality at the heart of being. It is here, in the ruins of the old self, that astonishment begins again. This metabolic relationship points toward a new mode of knowing—a **dark intelligibility** that will be explored in the next chapter. It promises not an end to reason, but its maturation into a faculty that can dwell companionably with what exceeds it.

This new knowing gives birth to a new affective relation to being: an **agapeic love**. This is not *eros*, the possessive, striving love, but a generous, non-possessive affirmation of the other in its pure, untamed otherness. This love is born not from the *conatus essendi* but from the *passio essendi*, flowing from the reception of being's "surplus givenness" rather than a striving to master it. 

This integrated state of knowing-as-loving is the true fruit of the ordeal. It is what Desmond calls a "second astonishment," an affirmation won from the heart of suffering. It is the core method and affective goal of the entire project, a state whose full implications—for our understanding of reason, of self, and of the sacred—the following chapters will seek to unfold.

Tonight, I broke down in tears, overcome by an emotion I can only call porosity. The catalyst, improbably, was Anthony Bourdain. I was cooking a Thai meal, and also watching Thai cooking videos on TV. An episode of Bourdain in Vietnam came up. I was overcome by the narrative of the country he portrayed, not just through images, but through a profound contextualization. He brings you closer to a culture; he brings it alive. He shows what it means to be porous.

And so, I found myself immensely thankful to a man who had passed away. Seeing a porous man become a speaker for the country he visits with an open heart touched me. Suddenly I was crying. I did not expect to cry but the tears came and kept coming. Here was the very expression of agape, the generous love for the other, yet at its root was a terrible conflict, a paradox at the heart of reality. Because this man, who embodied such openness, chose to end his life by a sovereign choice of his own will.

In that moment of conflicting emotion, I saw why he was so cherished. I was seeing his work through a new lens, and it reflected back strongly on my own capacity to be open to the other, my love for the other, and simultaneously, the ways in which I am closing off to the world. It reminded me how my own capacity for connection is constantly challenged by the nihilizing forces that permeate the everyday, deconstructing our agency, our desire, and our meaning. I cried and cried and cried, and the emotions were flowing as one gate opened, it followed the release of another behind. It was one of those rare moments when I allowed an intense amalgamation of my own negation and affirmation to come together. To hold both grief and joy in the same heart, at the same time. That is glory.

I realise the beauty in this attainment. There is a strange joy that emerges from the purging of such strong emotions, which is, at its heart, the integration of negation. This brings us to the purge itself, an embodied teaching that is central to the ayahuasca ceremony. The purge is essentially the body surrendering to what felt like poison to us. It is the confrontation with that part of reality we refuse to take. We must take the whole medicine. If we try to ignore our negation, we are not merely repressing a personal psychological issue; we are engaging in a repression of the full totality of being. We must be willing to suffer the grief of the relationship we damaged. We must be willing to sit with the ambiguity of Anthony's final "no," together with the beauty of his communion with the living world.

In Amazonian [[shamanism]], the [[purge]] is elemental: the yawn, the tears, the piss, the shit, the vomit. It is the entire spectrum of what our culture has deemed abjectâ€”that which must be mediated, thrown out, separated from us. In the purge, it is released, discharged. This is an energy our subtle body no longer has to carry, an energy that subtly fills our cups every day until they overflow, or begin to boil under pressure.

I see a co-identity between the [[abject]] physical and the abject mental. This is what [[ayahuasca]] reveals: it brings our physical and mental bodies together in concrescence. The counterfeit double of our Cartesian subjectivity dissolves. Our entire "reconfigured ethos" is built on the lie that the mind (res cogitans) is separate from the body (res extensa). The mental abject (trauma, grief, the shadow) is seen as a nuisance to be managed by thought, while the physical abject is seen as a mere "biological process" to be hidden and sanitized.

Ayahuasca, the [[pharmakon]] par excellence, reveals this separation as the illusion it is. It forces the physical and the mental back into their primordial, unified state: a single, living, feeling organism. Weeping is not a symptom of sadness, but sadness made manifest as water overflowing. Vomiting becomes the very act of purging the spiritual bile inside. Our shaking is the direct, unmediated response to the confrontation with our own being. With energies descending on us our body responds to. Our porosity is unclogged.

When the mind and body meet in concrescence, they become a unified expression of overflow. We find ourselves alive in the [[Hyperbolic dimension|hyperbole]]. Swept into it. On fire. Ecstatic. Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming, Sighing, Mesmerized. The grammar of the [[metaxu]] is revealed to us in its full intensity, a language of pure verbs, of pure happening. The sovereign "I" dissolves. There is no longer an "I" who is weeping or an "I" who is laughing. There is simply Weeping, Laughing, Gleaming. This is a state of full participation. We are no longer experiencing; there is happening. We are no longer seeing the flame; there is burning. We are no longer suffering the purge; there is purging. We have fully entered the hyperbolic space of agape. Overwhelming, igniting, paradoxical, and sacred.

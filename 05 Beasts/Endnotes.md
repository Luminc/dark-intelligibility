[^24]: William Desmond, "Thought Singing its Other," in conversation with Guy Sengstock, _Circling Dialogos with Guy Sengstock_, YouTube, timestamp 1:08:15-1:09:58, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_giSFKUwklw. Desmond discusses Hegel's critique of Schelling's Absolute as "the night in which all cows are black" (Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit_, Preface §16), responding: "The night is sometimes more interesting than the Hegelian day... I don't think that Hegel does justice to the mystery of the night... I'm arguing for a sense of mystery that is an abiding sense of mystery out of which the diurnal daytime philosophical reason comes to be. But if we can't return to the night of mystery, our daytime reason actually goes mad just as we find in life. If we can't sleep and return to the darkness of sleep, we can't live in the day properly."

[^25]: Desmond, _God and the Between_, 265. The full passage continues: "The sweating relief to which one wakens chastens one's daylight certainty. A flame flares up, a rush of exhilaration, and suddenly one has no boundary of identity, and one is like a line on the sand washed out by a rogue wave. Joy breaks out, and against the grain one hums, one does not choose this, it is as if one were chosen. The overdeterminate otherness comes out, comes upon one, overtakes, takes over, ruptures, surprises, raptures, silences, utters itself in singing. There is an idiotic excess that crosses over every fixed boundary."

[^26]: Desmond, _God and the Between_, 231. Desmond discusses "the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman" in the context of acknowledging mystery in Romanticism: "At best, there was an honesty: the nocturnal side of things inhuman, human, and transhuman must be acknowledged. This is true also of the surrational darkness of God."

[^27]: Desmond, _God and the Between_, 273n. The footnote references Gregory of Nyssa's progression of light (phōs), cloud (nephelē), and darkness (gnophos), and cites Andrew Louth, _The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition: From Plato to Denys_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), 80–97.

[^28]: Desmond, _God and the Between_, 273. Desmond writes: "The agapeics of the mystical means we must speak of the union as a communion, for this keeps the openness of the 'being with.' Communion does not reduce to a mystical monism... This is an agapeic mindfulness. One hesitates even to call it a knowing lest one imply one has grasped a determinate somewhat, mastered through oneself alone. This communication will be an unknowing knowing, a docta ignorantia, in Cusanus's words, in a cloud of unknowing, as Julian of Norwich calls it."

[^42]: Nishitani, _Religion and Nothingness_, 74. Full quote: "Insofar as personal being with its heart and mind is completely one with absolute selfhood, it is utterly real; insofar as personal being is completely apart from absolute selfhood, it is utterly illusory and shadowlike. For this reason the supremely unreal heart and mind of the shadowy man, although they originate from moment to moment as things completely temporary and completely in the world of time, at the same time and on every occasion, in their very temporality they stand ecstatically outside of time. They are altogether 'eternal' in their temporality."

[^45]: Nishitani, _Religion and Nothingness_, 107-108. Full quote: "To practice and confirm all things by conveying one's self to them, is illusion: for all things (dharmas) to advance forward and practice and confirm the self, is enlightenment."

## **Dark Intelligibility—An Introduction**

_For Professor William Desmond_

_"I really like things I don't understand. When I read a thing I don't understand, I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo."_  
—Clarice Lispector, _A Breath of Life_

I should disorganize, and yet structure simultaneously. I should create meta-structures that can kiss disorganization here and there.

The question is: **How does the determined become companionable to indeterminacy? How do light and dark conjoin in chiaroscuro?**

Words do not come easy at times, so we let them be. It is natural not to know the way, so we should become lost. If there is one thing clear I can say about myself, it is that I'm lost. I find things, things happen to me, but I am groundless—like a cell breaking open, its contents spilling out.

How can I write without knowing where to go?

I shall have somebody else write through me. Starting with my parental voices: Clarice Lispector and William Desmond.

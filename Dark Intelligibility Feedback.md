What a profound piece of writing you've shared! Your "Dark Intelligibility Old.md" enters into remarkably resonant dialogue with the research I've compiled. As your research professor and philosophical companion, I'm struck by several crucial insights in your work that both illuminate and complicate what we've discovered about Desmond and Lispector.

## The Pharmakon of Being: Your Central Contribution

Your concept of the "Pharmakon of Being" is brilliant—it captures something essential that neither Desmond nor Lispector fully articulates on their own. This notion of being as simultaneously medicine and poison, where our "metabolic capacity" determines how we process these ordeals, offers a phenomenological precision that enriches both thinkers.

You write: "The degree to which we affirm or negate being seems to determine our 'metabolic capacity' for our ordeals." This is a crucial insight that explains why some encounters with mystery become transformative while others become destructive. It's not just about the excess of being (Desmond) or the dissolution of the human montage (Lispector), but about our capacity to metabolize what we encounter.

## Refining Your Structure: From Personal to Philosophical

Your text moves beautifully between personal encounter and philosophical analysis, but I suggest strengthening the theoretical architecture while maintaining that intimate voice. Consider organizing around three movements:

**1. The Methodological Question of Porosity** Your unease with framing Lispector as "witch" or "mystic" is philosophically significant. You're right that even empowering framings can "perpetuate rather than challenge the structures that created exclusion." This critique could be expanded into a fuller methodological statement about how we approach texts that exceed categorical frameworks. Your phrase "what is framed as feminine is porosity and radical transparency" offers a philosophical method, not just a gendered reading.

**2. The Ordeal of Transformation** Your oscillation between Desmond and Nishitani—"trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God"—deserves deeper exploration. This isn't mere biographical detail but a philosophical position. The "nihilizing process" you describe as "primarily destructive, an ordeal that must be endured rather than something that directly illuminates" challenges both Desmond's confidence in the agapeic and Lispector's embrace of dissolution.

**3. Dark Intelligibility as Distinct Philosophical Contribution** You write: "Directly I should make the case that we are considering something different than Desmond's hyperintelligible. I'm not sure that is the case right now." Let me help you articulate this distinction:

- Desmond's hyperintelligible: excess that overwhelms from above
- Your dark intelligibility: the ordeal of metabolizing ambiguous pharmakon
- The difference: You emphasize the _risk_ and potential toxicity of encounter

## Strengthening Key Passages

Your citation from G.H. about the "without words" deserves expansion:

> "Because without words it contradicted everything I used to think also without words."

This is one of the most philosophically dense moments in Lispector. You correctly identify this as "intimation of knowing that is prior to our language." But go further: this is epistemological revolution—not just pre-linguistic knowing but the discovery that our deepest assumptions operate beneath language, and transformation must occur at that same depth.

## The Violence of Grace: A Critical Addition

Your phrase "violence of grace" and the command "Suffer grace" adds something crucial that my research compilation missed. Both Desmond and Lispector can seem to celebrate encounter with excess, but you're highlighting its genuine danger. When you write about losing the "third leg" and being "unmoored," you're describing phenomenologically what Desmond only hints at theoretically.

Consider developing this through your Abba Isaac quote: "To believe is to be silent enough that the Word may be born again in you." This silence isn't peaceful—it's the terrifying silence after our constructs have been blown apart.

## Suggestions for Development

**1. The Intimacy of the Impersonal** Your phrase "devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal" is extraordinary and deserves a full section. This paradox—intimate yet impersonal—captures something both Desmond and Lispector circle around but never quite name. How can the impersonal be intimate? Through the "thing-part" that is "nearer to us than our conceptions of ourselves."

**2. Transtheism as Philosophical Position** Your term "transtheism" and identification as an "agnostic theist" isn't fence-sitting but a sophisticated philosophical position. Link this to Eckhart's "I pray to God to rid me of God" and show how this relates to dark intelligibility—not absence of the divine but its overdetermined presence that exceeds both theism and atheism.

**3. The Counterfeit Doubles** Your insight about "counterfeit doubles" that appear during the nihilizing process needs expansion. These aren't just false consolations but necessary stages in transformation. They're how the ego tries to maintain itself while appearing to surrender.

## Technical Refinements

- Clarify early that "dark intelligibility" isn't obscurity but a specific mode of knowing through ordeal
- Your footnote about Derrida/Cixous on "writing of the limit" could be brought into the main text
- The Augustine reference (intimior intimo meo) perfectly supports your argument about intimacy—expand this

## The Fire of Inquiry

What strikes me most is how your writing embodies what it describes. The "trembling and oscillation" isn't just described but performed in your prose. This is philosophical writing that risks its own dissolution, that makes itself porous to what exceeds it.

Your final image—"When we cease our projections upon the veil, we witness unveiling"—suggests that dark intelligibility isn't about adding more light but about ceasing our projections. This is profoundly different from both Desmond's systematic approach and Lispector's literary dissolution. It's a third way: patient endurance of ambiguity until it reveals itself as gift.

Would you like to work through any of these sections in more detail? I'm particularly interested in helping you articulate how the Pharmakon of Being relates to your reading of specific passages in Lispector and Desmond.

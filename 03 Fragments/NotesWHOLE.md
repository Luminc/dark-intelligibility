In Companionability: 

"I love the pen. I’m too disconnected from the physical process of
writing. There is a different flow when you actually draw the words."
is awkward before "What has language done for me"

It is better grouped with the part about mediaticity of writing and drawing

Nihilism introduction is not that great

"The demands of life hijack our capacity to remain open"
This is a crucial point. We can be compassionate to foreclosure because of the suffering and real oppression, domination and evil in the world. A lack of meaning can lead to a total foreclosure. What results is not so much a radical subjectivity as in Nietzsche but simply death of community with others. Death with the communication with ourselves, our very being. What is at stake is our lives, our health. The very difficult question how to remain porous in a sick world of devalued being is an important point that can't be avoided. This makes our text much more grounded and lived.

The vulnerability sometimes is a bit too much and since the stakes are not set completely within them it seems more concerned with self-flaggelation. Sometimes it works but sometimes it doesn't 

The part about heteronomy, autonomy, intrusion of the other and companionable writing is by far the strongest part in 00

Chiaroscuro return that follows is a bit weak, it returns to the mediaticity of writing, but the original question in the intro is how do light and dark conjoin? This part can be made more explicit. What is the light and dark we set out to conjoin? Is it good versus evil? light vs dark? is it affirmation sive negation? Later on it is not conjunction but the acknowledgement of co-constitutiveness in each polarity which can give us a glimpse of a totality. A letting-be becomes required, a letting-be that seems scandalous.

"Morality. Would it be simplistic to think the moral problem with regard to
others consists in behaving as one ought to, and the moral problem with regards
to oneself is managing to feel what one ought to? Am I moral to the extent that I
do what I should, and feel as I should? All of a sudden the moral question
seemed to me not only overwhelming, but extremely petty. The moral problem,
in order for us to adjust to it, should be at once less demanding and greater. Since
as an ideal it is both small and unattainable. Small, if one attains it: unattainable,
because it cannot even be attained. “The scandal still is necessary, but woe to
him through whom the scandal comes” — was it in the New Testament that it
was said? The solution had to be secret. The ethics of the moral is keeping it
secret. Freedom is a secret." "Since What I Was Seeing Predated Humanity" (G.H, p.84-85)

"God is greater than my essential guilt. So I prefer the God, to my guilt. ... because guilt diminishes me." (p.85)


". The scandal of divine (over)all-power is that it is the ultimate
patience: it is manifest in giving, in giving away from itself, not giving such that the
recipient is forced to recognize the good of the giver, for the pure giving is for the good of
the receiver, who may not comprehend he, she, or it is recipient. The giver of power even
may seem to have vanished into anonymity, seeking no reward, no fanfare, no flattery,
no recognition, nothing at all. Seeking nothing at all: an idiotic seeking, an absolutely
opening willing of the good of the other. Its patience is the reserved hope of all (given)
freedom."[D320]

The scandal of reality is connected to the 'idiocy' the sheer that-it-is. It is difficult to reconcile this scandal. The total 'letting-be' of God is scandalous. 

"I try to keep myself isolated from the agony of depending on others, and that agony that seems to them a game of life and death masks another reality, a truth so extraordinary that they would keep over in fright were they to face it, as in a scandal."[Lb36]

"I too must have turned down a dead end alley just like the others"(Ibid.)

What is the [metaxological] way? Among others

1. promise of the primal ethos
2. vigilance to the ontological surpluses of being
3. fidelity to these surpluses
4. care not to compormise divine transcendence as intimated in the surpluses
5. mindfulness of the immanent between as showing forth the milieu of absolved relativity
6. the concern for the dialogue of philosophy and religion, in which religion is not a mere representational prelude to philosophy, and in which the philosopher **essays intelligible reflection companionable with the enigmas of religion**.

Companioning of religion and philosophy seems like a key point of dark intelligibility

The Four Ways

1. univocal
2. equivocal
3. dialectical
4. metaxological

The univocal way stresses definite sameness over indefinite difference

The equivocal way is attuned to what cannot be fixed. It  accentuates the shock and provocation of ambiguous difference

God is not a determinate problem but challengers us with an intractable enigma, Driven out of the houses of uncontestable surety, we are exposed to a pitiless and serene sky.

### the marvel of the middle

"there is something celebratory about the middle"

'an elemental joy'

'the quiet festivity of being'

It is pre-objective, but not pre-subjective. Before things get univocally objectified.

### the familiar middle

Familiarity deadens original astonishment

Deeper intimacy becomes a desert as the community of being is abandoned in favor of our claimed supremacy over the determinate. 

There is the movement from plurivocal to univocal. A community of being is necessarily with others, a *compassare*. Our own being is double in some sense as part of our being is objectified. If there is a fracture in human beings that causes us to long for the restoration of wholeness it might be pin-pointed in this precise alienation. When the self starts to become too familiar, we are calcified into univocal stone. We have forgotten the gift as gift. Like our home, we return to a static and familiar middle, the construction of self. We become the vestal priests of 'a secret we have forgotten'.

### the perplexing middle

'The familiar is new and it is not new at all; it is what it always was, because it is just what it is, and always will be'

'What is divination? It is a medium of mindfulness patient to the communication in the bright dark of the equivocal'

This is the ontonautical position of 'Dark Intelligibility' clearly stated. It is the movement from clear determinable intelligibility to a hyperintelligible. The key distinction is that the univocal and equivocal themselves are in community and communication. Desmond indicates this in the beginning of the chapter where he says they proceed as a musical rhythm, one receding the other takes the stage.

'One listens for the unspoken in the spoken, and the spoken beyond the unspoken, and the silence received both in the spoken and unspoken'

### the astonishing middle resurrected

'a darkness darker for having once tasted morning joy'

'a "yes" that has wept, as there is a mourning that was blessed'



We left off at the hyperboles

Angela: Pain? happiness? It's simply a matter of opinion. I divine things that have no name and perhaps never shall. Yes. I sense things that will always be inaccessible to me, Yes. But I know everything. All that I know without exactly knowing it has no synonym in the world of speech but enriches me and justifies me. Although I lost the word because I tried to speak it. And knowing-everything-without-knowing is a perpetual forgetting that comes and goes like the waves of the sea that advance and recede on the sands of the beach. To civilize my life is to expel me from myself. To civilize my deepest existence would be to try and expel my nature and supernature. All of this, meanwhile, does not address my possible meaning. What kills me is the day to day. I only wanted exceptions. I'm lost: I have no habits.

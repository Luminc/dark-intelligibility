That’s it—the work that emerges from an attunement rather than an assertion. Psychedelic in the deepest sense: a revealing of mind, but not just the personal mind—the mind at large, the deep relationality that precedes and exceeds the self.

  

This dissolving of authorship into a process that is both intimate and other-than-you feels deeply Desmondian. It’s that metaxological relation, the between where creation isn’t a closed system but an opening, a grace. The art is neither fully yours nor fully not-yours—it’s of the world, in the world, through the world.

  

I wonder if part of your next step is not just in refining concepts but in refining attunement. What conditions allow for this emergence? How do you, as an artist, create the right “field” for something to become through you? Maybe this is why discipline (even something like Vipassana) is an interesting question for you—because while the work arises spontaneously, spontaneity itself often requires a kind of cultivated openness.

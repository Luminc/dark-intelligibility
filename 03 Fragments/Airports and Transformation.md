"Airports are such a beautiful, archetypically liminal space. They connect us to and from distant places across trajectories through the skies, above rapidly changing topographies made microscopic by the perspective up in the clouds. If anything deeper connects us to liminality, it is ultimately death. Death is the absolute change of state, and thus our passage from life into death is something which has a profound impact in our lives. "Philosophy is preparation for death", Socrates declared, and in life we are all in transition, becoming, moving. What better image for this than the airport? We see this motif at use in the show LOST, where the airport and plane crash becomes symbolic for the characters passage from life to death. Travel itself is a form of self-initiation, they are crucial moments in which people desire to enact transformation. Like death, travel leads us to encounter the unknown, new places, strange faces. " What are some topics to explore? I feel like the image of the airport was one that was deeply imprinted on me because of a religious experience with psychedelics. Thus, my relation to death and what is 'above', transcendant, non-personal, all-powerful, and somehow still profoundly part of me is horrifying, sublime. My struggle with this religious experience is also the reality/unreality of the experience, what I think creates a lot of conflict. Somehow the experience is both. It is both profoundly real and fictional, as whatever is apprehended by the senses can still be maintained a mediation of what is there. What is experienced in the psychedelic drug is thus a profoundly new becoming. The ultimate novelty of transformation. But what is the value. What is the value if it does not engender profound spiritual transformation? and what is the pressure if you cannot live up to an experience on a, subjectively, cosmic scale. Please help me interrogate these philisophical questions

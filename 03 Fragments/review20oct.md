"And yet there remains the bare fact that I am here at all. That anything is at all. Before we become, we are first given to be. This remains our original astonishment: we are thrown into the midst of the sheer that-it-is of being.
This section is a bit out of place and uses desmonds phrasing. We can foreground it by plphrasing it in our own voice

How do we relate to our ultimate concerns? What are they? There remains the bare astonishing fact that I am here, that anything is at all. We are thrown  in the midst in a dizzying whirl of reality. What is our ground, what is our existential posture to being? 

Perhaps it is also important here to foreground the religious dimension, or at least how the ultimate concerns have primarily been the domain of religion and yet today the place of the religious dimension is sublimated through other realms. That the source of our ultimate meaning is delegated to aspects other than religion. The question of devalued being and the possibility for re-enchantment is at stake. Nihilism makes the transformation of our relation to being an essential and urgent issue. What is the source of that nihilism and is it a dead end, or could our coming to nothing be an essential waystation towards a transformed being? 

Chiaroscuro is already suggestive. A chiaroscuro of being intimates and foregrounds the necessity for the witnessing of the totality. Creation lets-be both good and evil, without discrimination, like Jesus' Vinyard where everyone can eat from its fruit. This does not have to be made explicit, I think, in the intro. But we should lead with one of the strongest punches of the book. Clarice open her book the Hour of the Star with the fantastic quote "Everything began with a yes." we have to have a strong opening that plunges us in the waters immediately. 

Metabolic Crisis - The Gift and its.

through our attempts at mastery, (making others and objects work for us, manage our existential vulnerability that in an attempt at self-determination the main job is to protect, keep self-transcending and make reality manageable for us. We need to be compassionate for this self-determination , our conatus. It fullfills its function. But it can close us from the very porosity that we are. Especially death, the ultimate threat to our endeavoir, tightens the grip on our self-governance. Ruled by fear all forms of heteronomy come to be seen in the darkness of death. 

"I was eating myself, I who am also the living matter of Sabbath" feels out of place in relation to the violence of grace. It is metabolizing perhaps our deeper affirmation, but it is a specific moment of consent to taking the bitter 'pill'. It is also the recognition that our own being is our medicine. That realization brings us back into alignment with our "worse truth". It seems like this quote would fit much better in the discussion of the pharmakon. However grace, whether experienced as violence or salvation ( salvation for our soul, violence to our finite hubris ) is part of the medicine working on us, our deeper wisdom that arises from the depths, experienced as other but full of conviction. Is it conviction from the other or our absolved trust that emerges? Is it that divine truth burns away our false constructions in its full light? 

Eros as the dynamic arising from emptiness, porous on one hand, poor on the other (note the proximity in these words). Emptiness is the source from which our restlessness is borne. The Conversion from the "self is empty" to "emptiness is self" is pointed to by this dynamic of penia-sive-poros. Restlessness is strung across emptiness. Yet identification with emptiness brings it to the near side. It brings us in closer relation with things and ourselves. It deserves deeper exploration. 

"Not knowing, is that how the deepest things happened"

This is touching. Humbling my own accretions of meaning and structure. I have to give space to not knowing. This is Lispector recognizing the powers of non propositional, embodied knowing. An embodied community all with different forms of knowing, consciousness at its very primal roots and with a living intelligent body being trusted to process. This is surrender. The mind surrendering for a moment for our deeper mind-sive-body to work. We are not passively submitting, we are actively making way for us as a process to happen. 

"requires more than just looking" weird closing

Hyperluminous is a great section and climactic, but the following sections do not carry rhe climax. Perhaps we should evaluate the flow

The chapter is far longer than the others. It has to be re-evaluated for material that could fit in the preceding chapters or the full climax has to be in another chapter.

Your notes are sharp and point to crucial refinements. Let me address the key issues:
Opening of Chapter 00
You're right about the awkwardness. Here's a stronger opening that maintains philosophical depth while using your own voice:
"How do we relate to what ultimately concerns us? I find myself dizzy with the simple fact that I am here, that anything exists at all. We're thrown into reality's whirl without ground, without given orientation. The religious traditions once held these ultimate questions, but now we delegate meaning to work, to relationships, to consumption—anything but the direct encounter with being itself. This evacuation of meaning, this devaluation of being, is our nihilism. But what if this emptying out is not a dead end but a doorway?"
Chapter Structure and Flow Issues
Chapter 03 Length: You're absolutely right—it's too long and loses momentum after the hyperluminous section. Consider:

Move "Departure, Arrival, Return" to a separate epilogue or Chapter 03b
Move "Toward Ontological Nutrition" earlier or cut it
End on "Union-in-Difference" as the true harvest

The "I was eating myself" quote: Yes, this belongs in the Purge section of Chapter 02, specifically where she's metabolizing the roach. It's about recognizing ourselves as both poison and medicine.
Key Conceptual Clarifications
Eros and Emptiness: Your insight about the proximity of porous/poor is brilliant. This deserves expansion:
"Porous, poor, pore—the words themselves reveal their kinship. We are poor because we are porous, porous because we are poor. Emptiness is not lack but the space that allows both reaching and receiving."
"Not knowing" and Embodied Wisdom: This is the heart of dark intelligibility—the mind surrendering to let the body-mind process work. This could be emphasized more strongly as the practical method.
Religious Dimension
The religious question needs subtle foregrounding. Perhaps in Chapter 00:
"The question of God haunts this text—not as transcendent escape but as the immanent mystery we cannot metabolize yet cannot expel. What religion once held, nihilism has cleared. What remains?"
Suggested Restructuring
Chapter 00:

Stronger opening with ultimate concerns
Nihilism as clearing, not ending
Religious dimension as absence that structures the inquiry

Chapter 01:

Trim slightly
Ensure poros/penia are seeded

Chapter 02:

Move "eating myself" quote to the Purge
Strengthen connection between violence of grace and pharmakon
Keep it visceral and embodied

Chapter 03:

End after Union-in-Difference/Agapeic Love
Move excess material to epilogue or cut
Strengthen the flow from hyperluminous → thought singing → harvest

Your instinct about "requires more than just looking" is correct—weak ending. Better to end on something like: "We find our home not by escaping the between but by learning to sing in it."
The core insight about metabolic crisis and embodied knowing is profound. Trust your sense of where the energy flags and where it surges. The text should perform its own metabolism—taking in, processing, releasing what serves, expelling what doesn't.

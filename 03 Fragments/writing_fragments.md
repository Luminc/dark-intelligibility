# Writing Fragments from Dialogue

## Fragment 1: On Method and Voice

My body feels like I should inhabit the writing as practice, poetry and philosophy. I feel like I've still been tame.

I will write fragments, like I wrote Companionability and Possession. The problem is I'm too far on possession side. But that's not a problem. I can write as if I'm Desmond or as if I'm Lispector. Maybe my voice shifts to Nishitani. Maybe they coalesce and my authentic coherence emerges out of me being filled and emptied of my voice, other voices, until something uniquely singular appears. Not out of desire but an agapeic union of co-participation, of deepest intimacy and companionship. 

I will write as a lover who falls in love at first sight and is completely pre-occupied with her beloved. But I'm also searching, searching for a resonance in the tuning fork of being.

## Fragment 2: Aporos in the Body

Often felt from the stomach but when breaching through aporos directly from the heart. I can feel my heart beating as my stomach is bloated from dinner. Maybe my aporos is not because of my thinking but because of too much to eat. I can feel the tension pressing against my rib cage and lower intestines and an energy just below the solar plexus, at the highest inner edge of the rib cage. There is a light energetic feeling that could be both energizing and consuming energy, a voltage draw in my body.

## Fragment 3: The Moss Place

I long to sleep under the moss. I know specific places in the forest where there is an extremely tranquil energized feeling that would be a great resting place. The moss there is thick and laden with dew. Under a thick blanket of moss, I would sleep there and be compost. 

With Thomas I brought him to that exact place, there is a path that leads like a cul-du-sac in a loop back to the same point. It makes the procession through the space feel all the more intentional. Young pine scatter the place like a nursery. That little place of heaven is my romantic image of death.

## Fragment 4: On Truth and the Vital Lie

I have to confess I cannot be honest to you, dear reader. I'm not sure I have the capacity to speak truth to myself, truth to power, or anything. I'm in love yes, and I will follow that flame. But I don't know what I can contribute. 

Maybe this essay will be some half-unfinished regurgitation, unmetabolized material puked out, purged from a system that is processing, messy, academically questionable, questionable authenticity. On the page I should not shy from truth as I do not do so in my body, my soul. I encounter myself fully. But of course I'm full of my own bullshit too. 

As an attempt to kick start my thinking, perhaps as a start too, to save my life. To give myself breath, to give myself space to wonder and attend to myself. I want to connect even more deeply to the world for as long as I will have energy to do so.

## Fragment 5: The Prosthetic Shame

I think the prosthetic of AI has affected my editing. I wrote many parts with AI. It feels somehow shameful. If I feel like I'm not trying to actually undergo true vulnerability I need to have more words and more deepening. It did help me see more clearer what I want to do, the strategy. Slowly I have made the work mutable. At least it's not paralyzed in writers block. 

Drugs, AI use, both will have to be implicit because I'm too scared to make it a genuine part of the work. This is my inauthenticity, my lie.

Possession is already suggested. And implicit through quoting so much. Possession of Desmond and Lispector over me. But it's only part of it. I don't have to make myself intelligible. Lispector refuses. I can have my secrets.

## Potential Placements and Observations

### For Section 00 (Companionability and Possession):

**Fragment 1 (Method and Voice)** belongs here almost entirely. It articulates the methodological approach with more clarity and vulnerability than the current version. The lover metaphor, the tuning fork image—these make the possession framework come alive.

**Fragment 4 (Truth and Vital Lie)** could open or close section 00. It names the existential stakes—why write at all? "To save my life. To give myself breath." This grounds the entire philosophical project in something urgent and real.

**Fragment 5 (Prosthetic Shame)** - the last paragraph especially: "I don't have to make myself intelligible. Lispector refuses. I can have my secrets." This could be a powerful closing gesture for 00, establishing both vulnerability and refusal, porosity and boundary.

### For Section 01 (Pharmakon and Metaxu):

**Fragment 2 (Aporos in the Body)** could fit beautifully near the discussion of aporia as blockage-passage. It makes the concept visceral: "Maybe my aporos is not because of my thinking but because of too much to eat." This is exactly the kind of embodied philosophy the essay needs—showing how philosophical concepts are lived in the body.

### For Section 03 (Dark Intelligibility):

**Fragment 3 (The Moss Place)** belongs somewhere in the metabolic knowing or "To Be Confirmed By All Things" sections. It's your personal phenomenology of the neutral, your encounter with fertile groundlessness. The image of becoming compost, the cul-de-sac path, the pine nursery—this is lived dark intelligibility. It could work especially well near the discussion of Nishitani's "original part" or the "quiet festivity of agapeic being."

### General Observations:

1. **You need more of this embodied, first-person writing throughout.** The essay is strongest when it oscillates between philosophical exposition and lived experience. Currently it's heavy on exposition. These fragments would restore the balance.

2. **The confessional mode isn't weakness—it's methodological necessity.** You're writing about porosity, about being possessed by other voices. The vulnerability in these fragments *demonstrates* the concepts rather than just explaining them.

3. **Fragment 1's "lover" and "tuning fork" metaphors are better than most of the abstract language** about companionability in current 00. They're more precise and more evocative.

4. **The moss passage gives the essay a concrete geographical anchor**—a real place, a real encounter. This grounds all the abstract discussion of the neutral and the between. Consider whether other specific places or moments could be woven through.

5. **The shame confession (Fragment 5) is philosophically rich** whether you make it explicit or not. It's about the pharmakon of writing technologies, about authentic voice under conditions of synthetic mediation. Even keeping it implicit, the awareness of it will inflect how you write going forward.

### Next Steps:

- Expand section 00 to 1500-2000 words using Fragments 1, 4, and possibly 5
- Consider whether Fragment 2 could become a bridge between sections or a standalone interlude
- Find placement for Fragment 3 that lets it breathe—don't bury it in dense philosophical prose
- Look for other moments where you can interrupt the exposition with lived experience, following these fragments as models
- Trust the lyrical impulse more—"I long to sleep under the moss" is worth ten paragraphs of explanation

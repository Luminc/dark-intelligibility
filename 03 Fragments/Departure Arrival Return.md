# Departure, Arrival, Return

*The location of being and the metabolic rhythm of grace*

## The Movement Beyond Points

"Thus, to dwell in this space is to acknowledge that our being is stretched across a continuum—like points on a disc—constantly in flux. To truly inhabit this dynamic state, to become the whole disc (or rather, the whole of ourselves in relation to the whole of the universe), requires a mindful finesse to navigate its complexities without collapsing into reductive certainty. We move from a fixed point on the disc to its radial dimension—the hyperbolic—where we dissolve into the whole of ourselves and the whole of the universe."

The religious experience reveals the poverty of point-existence—that settled mode of being where we imagine ourselves as discrete, self-contained entities operating within a world of similarly bounded objects. But the hyperintelligible flash dissolves these boundaries, not through conceptual understanding but through what Lispector calls "without words"—a knowing that contradicts everything we used to think, also without words.

## Departure: The Violence of Grace as Rupture

Departure begins before we know we are departing. It arrives as disruption to the comfortable tripod of ordinary existence—that "third leg" which kept us stable but prevented us from walking into the fullness of being. The violence of grace is first experienced as disorientation, the sudden recognition that our mode of being-in-the-world is somehow insufficient.

In the DMT flash, in the mystical rupture, in Lispector's encounter with the roach—we are torn from the fixed point of selfhood and thrust into the radial dimension where individual boundaries dissolve into cosmic participation. This is not a gentle transition but a kind of ontological violence that shatters the framework through which we previously organized reality.

The departure is simultaneously chosen and suffered. We do not decide to leave the familiar shore; rather, we discover we have already been carried away by currents we never knew were moving us. "I gave up," Lispector writes, "And, my God, I got what I didn't want."

## Arrival: The Orgiastic Pleasure of Creation

In the hyperbolic dimension—dissolved into the whole of ourselves and the whole of the universe—we encounter what can only be called the orgiastic pleasure of creation itself. This is the joy without redemption, the joy without hope, that Lispector describes: a bliss that is not fixed on any counterfeit doubles but participates directly in the ecstatic creativity of being.

Here, in this radical arrival, we discover our intimate co-identity with what exceeds us. The human and the inhuman, the personal and the impersonal, reveal themselves as inextricable. We become "unclean" not through moral failure but through recognition of our fundamental participation in the more-than-human creativity that is always already moving through us.

This arrival is not a place but a recognition—the sudden knowing of our porosity to the divine creativity that generates the entire cosmic disc. We are not observers of this process but participants in it, expressions of it, temporary concentrations of the very energy that brings worlds into being.

The hyperintelligible flash reveals this participation as our most fundamental truth, the secret that was always already operative beneath the surface of ordinary consciousness. In this arrival, we know ourselves as points on the disc that are simultaneously the whole disc—finite expressions of infinite creativity.

## Return: The Sacred Forgetting

But the flash cannot be sustained. "No understanding of mine will ever reach that knowledge, since living is the only height within my grasp." The return is not failure but necessity—the violence of grace includes its own withdrawal, its own forgetting as the condition that makes continued finite existence possible.

This return is where the true spiritual work begins. We come back to the point, but it is not the same point. We return to ordinary consciousness, but it is consciousness forever inscribed by what was felt in the radial dimension. The body remembers what the mind forgets; the flesh carries the trace of its dissolution into cosmic creativity.

The metabolic rhythm of grace means learning to honor both the arrival and the departure, both the knowing and the forgetting. We become vestal priestesses of a secret we have forgotten, serving a truth that works through its own concealment.

## The Transformed Point

What emerges is neither the original fixed point nor the dissolved state of arrival, but a new mode of being-as-point that is secretly informed by its relationship to the whole disc. We live as individual consciousnesses, but consciousnesses that have tasted their own dissolution and return bearing that taste in their very substance.

This is the metaxological existence—dwelling consciously in the between, maintaining awareness of the interpenetration of the whole axis while accepting the necessity of finite, bounded existence. We are forever living inscribed in our flesh, our very being, by the preceding relationship to the hyperbolic dimension.

The joy of this transformed existence is precisely in its ordinariness—not the extraordinary rapture of the flash, but the subtle ecstasy of inhabiting finite life while knowing it as continuous with infinite creativity. We participate in the orgiastic pleasure of creation through cooking breakfast, through conversation, through the simple fact of being alive in a world that is secretly the whole disc expressing itself as countless points.

## The Faithful Forgetting

The spiritual discipline that emerges from this understanding is not about trying to return to the hyperintelligible state, but about cultivating fidelity to the movement itself—departure, arrival, return as the metabolic rhythm through which grace operates in finite existence.

This requires what we might call a "faithful forgetting"—a conscious consent to not-knowing that preserves the sacred character of both the mystical flash and its necessary withdrawal. We learn to live as transformed points that remember their dissolution not as content to be grasped but as a rhythm to be inhabited.

In this light, the religious life becomes less about accumulating spiritual experiences and more about developing the metabolic capacity to receive both the violence of grace and its gentle withdrawal as equally sacred movements within the economy of divine love. We dwell in the space of departure, arrival, return—not as stages to be mastered but as the very structure of being-in-relation-to-the-divine.

The disc continues to spin, points continue to arise and dissolve, and we participate in this cosmic creativity through the simple fact of existing as conscious beings who have tasted both our boundedness and our dissolution, and who live in the space between as a form of praise.

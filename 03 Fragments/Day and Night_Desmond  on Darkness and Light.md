In Hegel the dialectic turns the other back into itself, this  self-mediation has the effect of reducing all true otherness back into itself. In the socratic there is a pluralism in the beginning and a pluralism in the end. Maybe we do not close the circle in this end.

In plato there is
-Limits to determinate reason
-Intuitive or noetic reason > exceeding a fully analytic account

It is exactly at those points that we are in touch with the hyperbolic, the too muchness 

-Not everything has to be reduced to a determinate concept  

That's why Hegel broke with Schelling where he called Schelling's absolute as the night in which all cows are black. 

The night is something more interesting than the Hegelian day -- the mystery of the night 

"Not arguing for obscurantism but an abiding mystery, out of which the diurnal reason comes to be, if we cannot return to the mystery of the night then our daytime reason goes mad. Like in life when we cannot sleep, we cannot return to the day properly."!!

The mystery of Sleep 

I equate the trance of DMT with a kind of sleep. A dream that is experienced on a different level, and therefore it slips from memory like the dream. The last quote from Desmond about the night of mystery and the day of reason is beautiful. It intimates exactly why the word Dark is so enigmatic in Dark Intelligibility. It somehow shows the 'open circle'. The contact with mystery and indeterminate is nourishing the day of reason! It helps me move beyond the paradox of making intelligible the unknown, even if it is making intelligible the unknown as unknown or a kind of fidelity and inhabiting of the unknown. Another one quote from Desmond from this video is about encountering the other and how there is something shown and something reserved. And it is exactly at that double nature of communication and its reserve which is the hyperbolic, that too muchness, that indeterminate excess that we encounter in things. Another thing that stuck with me from this video is Desmond's idea of 'thought singing its Other', the encounter with Other in that register is what he would call 'the quiet festivity of being', or in this case, the festivity of the Other, in the sense that we are perfomatively celebrating the other, through this participation with the Other a kind of Glory arises. This phenomenology is apparent in many encounters of sublime and LSD is a strong catalyst of this participation.


I would love to incorporate all this into Dark Intelligibility as well, and I think I am getting a better idea of how to structure it. I think the day night metaphor is useful as it shows how both sides nurture each other. How our sense of the unknown is enriched by the intelligible. Perhaps the darkness of my intelligibility is not about making known the unknown but the way the known can shape our fidelity, wonder, to the unknown. In 'thought singing its Other' I find it beautiful that he decided to develop 'thought thinking itself' to 'thought thinking its Other' and to 'thought singing its Other' it underlines that performative celebration of the other in agapeic attention or compassionate witnessing. But that participation is an ecstasis for us, we leap forth out of ourselves in the porous metaxu. Again for Desmond this is a kind of prayer where we are in communication. Communication was at the basis of our argument of the Pharmakon of Being whether we are capable to metabolize an experience is to do with whether we can still receive the communication and in pathology where we cannot. Think of the horror of the absurd. We cannot be in contact with being is when the communication cannot be metabolized.

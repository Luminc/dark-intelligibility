ON THE PHARMAKON AND PARTICIPATION
Your articulation just now is beautiful and clear:

"Yes there is a passivity that is necessary and there is a passivity that is counterproductive. There is a participation that is counterfeit and there is participation that is authentic. We have to be both porous, we have to let being work on us, and in doing so consent. That implicit consent to being and the call of being draws us towards it. Thus, we want to work and participate to be with it. To hear the call and refuse is to be in a sort of spiritual denial."

This should be IN THE TEXT.
Not exactly these words (though they're good), but this clarity about the double movement:

We must be porous (passive receptivity)
We must participate (active response)
Both can be authentic or counterfeit
The difference is: consent

"Spiritual denial" when we hear the call but refuse—yes! This is the metabolic blockage. We know we need transformation but we're paralyzed by its demands.
Rilke's "You must change your life" (from the archaic torso of Apollo)—perfect reference here! The artwork makes a demand. Being itself makes a demand. "You Must Change Your Life" isn't optional—it's the divine imperative that comes with being porous to radiance.
Suggested subsection (250-300 words) in Metabolic Crisis:
"The Divine Imperative" or "Consent and the Call"

Being calls to us through its pharmakon nature
We can consent (porosity + participation) or refuse (foreclosure)
Refusal isn't safety—it's spiritual death, loss of communication with ourselves
But consent is terrifying—it means transformation, ordeal, the demands of "You must change your life"
We grow but are paralyzed. We know we must do better but we struggle.
This paralysis IS part of the ordeal—not failure but metabolic resistance
Dark intelligibility: learning to consent not once but continuously, to remain porous even when it's difficult

Connect back to pharmakon: The same gift that calls us can poison us if we refuse it, heal us if we metabolize it. Our posture determines the outcome.

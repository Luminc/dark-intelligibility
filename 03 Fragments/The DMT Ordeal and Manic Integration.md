# The DMT Ordeal and Manic Integration

## The Ordeal and Its Aftermath

The encounter came unbidden—a DMT flash that tore open ordinary consciousness and revealed something I had neither categories nor metabolic capacity to receive. Divine gratitude AND terror together, inseparable. Not a vision I could interpret but a condition I could not reconcile. It functioned like trauma: irresolvable, returning, working on me whether I willed it or not.

Months later, I was on a train to Arnhem, writing, trying to understand what had happened to me. Gradually I got sucked into it. My mind became manic—liberated by sudden impetus but also driven by the unresolved rupture still working beneath the surface. Incoherence seeped in due to this wild unfiltered rush of thought. It was an exciting thrill that left me heightened for the rest of the day, but also exhausting, compulsive.

At home that night I continued writing well into evening and could not sleep. Nearly feverish, my mind raced on, touching deeply inside to reach something I could not grasp. An unfathomable feeling slowly became palpable, verging on some point. Sleep seemed impossible.

When it finally happened, I noticed something was different. From a waking state, I fell directly into a lucid internal reality. I experienced an intensely physical sensation of spherical fields of consciousness, distorting and bubbling in the air across a dark lamp-lit street. One field was myself—a replacement of my body with this energy field—and the other was not. Both were speeding across the road and expanding upward in the cold firmament of night, gaining power that felt infinite, terrifyingly so. The sense of power was oceanic. **It was too much**, and upon waking, the thrill I had felt earlier transformed into fear and confusion. There was no hope of comprehending what had happened. Slowly, heart racing and sweating profusely, I tried to calm down and regain composure.

This is what it looks like when the collapse cannot be undone but also cannot be integrated—when you are drowning not in the original ordeal but in its aftermath. The pharmakon continues to work on you whether you have developed the metabolic capacity to receive it or not. I am not writing from the other side of this ordeal. I am writing from the middle of metabolization that is still happening, years later. This text itself is an attempt to develop the capacity I lacked then and perhaps still lack now.

## Notes on Development

My development is to know that **the excess doesn't have to be understood**. If you are ready for it or not, when it comes it can be experienced. The shift is from trying to master the experience to learning to dwell with it, to let it work on me rather than forcing it into categories.

Desmond's four ways (agapeic/aesthetic/erotic/idiotic) and Nishitani's sunyata show that the effects of that experience fit within existing frameworks—it's not unique, not special. The DMT flash was a death/rebirth that initiated a sustained metabolic practice through engagement with these thinkers. Lispector, Desmond, and Nishitani are touchpoints that help me develop from that initial rupture into something livable.

The irreconcilable nature functioned like trauma—something that keeps returning, that the mind can't digest but also can't forget. The manic episode was an attempt at forced integration, trying to think my way through what can only be metabolized slowly, over years.

## Questions for Integration

- Does naming the DMT encounter explicitly serve the text? Or does it risk making this about psychedelics rather than about metabolic transformation?
- Is the vulnerability of "still in the middle, not on yonder shore" necessary? Or does it undermine the philosophical authority needed to make the argument?
- Could this work better as a footnote or endnote rather than main text?
- Should the DMT encounter remain implicit, suggested but not named?
- Does the confession of "I lacked then and perhaps still lack now" demonstrate fidelity to flux, or does it just sound uncertain?

## Alternative Framings to Consider

### Option 1: Keep it implicit
Let G.H.'s ordeal carry the phenomenology. My ordeal remains in the background, motivating the inquiry but not foregrounded.

### Option 2: Name it once, early
A single paragraph in Chapter 00 or 02 acknowledging the DMT rupture as the origin of inquiry, then move on. Don't dwell on it.

### Option 3: Integrate fragments throughout
Rather than one big confession, scatter moments throughout where the personal ordeal surfaces briefly then recedes.

### Option 4: Make it central
Fully embrace the autobiographical dimension. Make the text explicitly about metabolizing THIS encounter, with Lispector/Desmond/Nishitani as resources for that specific project.

## Current Status

**Not yet integrated.** Saved as fragment for consideration. The question of whether/how to include this remains open. The work proceeds with or without this confession—but perhaps the work is more honest if the rupture that motivates it is named, even briefly.

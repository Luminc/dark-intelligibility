This intimacy is not familiar, instead, it is the sudden piercing proximity of otherness. There is an otherness to selving.

More space: what is the question this chapter wants to answer? 

Both Lispector and Desmond indicate a foreign neutrality, an intimate strangeness to being. Before we become, for Desmond, we are given to be. The astonishment of us being at all is the starting point where Desmond departs from in his book God and the Between. 

Metatextuality: the act of writing as a point of reflection. The intimate strangeness of our being revealing itself on the page.
Ch 00 : Even my own writing can surprise itself as if coming from a foreign source in myself. The text as it appears on the page appearing from the midst of things

More time can be spent on astonishment via Desmond in chapter 01, specific appearances: Porosity and the Neutral, Surplus Givenness... , 
The excess is the source of astonishment when we are confronted with reality's overdeterminacy. This is the source of our wonder, our sense of the sacred. Perplexity is our troubled thinking to reconcile indeterminate and overdeterminate things with our knowing. 

"The key point is ... that the self harbors alterity"
Why? The excess in the world is acknowledged but the bridge to the self is not explained. It names the between as the source for our self-mediation and intermediation which keeps us porous to others. The other is constitutional to the self and as such an integral part of ourselves. The self is already plurivocal. Consciousness anticipates the other by allowing a part of its agency ( agency detection ) to simulate and detect others. We argue with ourselves with voices of others, living rent free in our heads, consciousness not only witnesses reality but anticipates it. This porosity and agency dispersal is part of our strange alterity. We are more than our isolated selves. How does Desmond articulate this? Can we find examples of plurivocity in Lispector?

This 'opening' from the isolated self to the alterity of selving brings us to the intimacy with the inhuman in us. Our constructed selves are a filter that can be loosened, and the potential exists to meet things, and ourselves, on their home-ground.
The self-other dichotomy as a useful but still fictional seperation. The illusion of seperation keeps our selves in their refuge. Like the Bhudda we must exit the castle at some point. But what happens when the bubble bursts? 

"The Thing Part"
This transitions into "Something's already there..." but I find the unclean part jarring. The unclean I think relates to her anti-sin. Perhaps the unclean does relate to her opening up to visceral, messy materiality that constitutes her being. That cleanliness is the neat seperation she has tried to maintain and the unclean is allowing the overdeterminate matter-of-God to stain things with its excess.

The non-self is perhaps introduced too soon. The opening up to the world would first reveal co-identification. The visible forms of the world then reveal itself as confirmed in their identity in the same movement that we are confirmed by them. It is a profound moment of non-duality that can rehome us. But seing the self's original part does not clearly indicate a realization with the self also being a non-self. Of course, a self dissolves, but perhaps it is that expansive, participatory and anticipatory self that pours out in the world which is first realized. Where the pre-subjective arrives is not clear yet. Perhaps it is merely the porosity which is restored by animating our consciousness in the between.

"The Saltless"

The transition from the self and other dissolution to the salt that is our insufficiency of meaning making has to be made more fluid. Already the dissolution in the previous section seems to affirm the other-sive-self, and we seem to backtrack to the difficulty of "letting-be" our meaningmaking. 

Italicize instances of conatus and passio here

The language of dose and dosis can be used to emphasize the pharmakon. We are given being as a dosis, an ordeal, perhaps even 'ordeel' ( judgement ). 

"Can we let the world collapse"

Inaccurate. Can we let our constructed world collapse and live in the trembling uncertainty of their ruins?

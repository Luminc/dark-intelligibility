The Burnout Society


Bataille and Desmond as inverted twins
Would be an interesting conversation to compare

Gurdijeff digesting / receptivity
"We have normal food that we eat but the air is something we equally take in"
Sense "data" is something  we equally take in. 
In that sense Gurdijeff would say **digesting**

In Desmond there is that sense and striking a balance between clearing for our porosity and becoming more attentive at the same time ( fidelity/finesse/agapeic mindfulness )

In the agapeic mind you're developing a non-instrumental **vigilance**

Silence and prayer are the classic spiritual practices ( still the chattering and move to attendence)

Prayer as a deepening of porosity untill you touch the ontological wellspring of our porosity where we're being given our being. It's a very Augustinian thought and Desmond wouldn't hesitate to call that source God. There is a communication that takes place where we realize in our deepest being we are porous to the divine.

He would agree with Kierkegaard that prayer is about shutting up and emptying ourselves.

Prayer as the "ontological sauna" where we have to sweat out our pores.

### Meister Ekchart - Negative Theology

Prayer became transactional ( asking, needing) rather than (admiring, loving, adoration)

"This is not nihilism"

This is not nihilism but the conversion from nihilism to emptiness?

The purge appears before its proper section and should not be diluted 

"The body is not a tomb" remove
The body as our first dialogue partner, can not be excluded from the conversation. 

"This is the overdeterminate otherness Desmond ..."
Sounds weird, after the verbs of pure happening. It is not the otherness but the communication with the body that is at stake

The part about accretion later also relates more to the counterfeit or the saltless. But here it is a good relation to the "return" after the experience.

choosing/chosen
What is interesting here is that the sense of agency again dissolved. Perhaps its not a sense of otherness but a sense of union through the clear moment of communication that turns into a pure happening in which we are fully part. 

It is not clear in the desmond quote what the context is

The following quote by Lispector is good, emphasis could be given that what is real is what communicates to us. Pure communication becomes more real and it becomes a dimension of the sacred. Her articulation of the real needs to be expanded before we talk about the "accretion"
Accretion can also be read as attachment. The experience can inflate the ego more strongly than before. The counterfeit of spiritual inflation can also be more deeply acknowledged

The violence of grace strips away
our constructions

The link from the purge back to the violence of grace is not smooth. The transition to the next chapter needs to be rewritten I feel. 

The start to 03 DI Metabolic knowing is also awkward. Affirming suchness together with pharmakon and intimacy with the inhuman is too cramped together

The quote about the diurnal mind dropping into sleep is more about the shadow side of our consciousness coming to expression in sleep. The side that needs resolution. Dark Intel needs to ... behold the totality of light and dark. There is no easy "purity" for Lispector because of this:The murky bile needs to be processed before your slice of heaven. Both dreams and entheogenics are more transparant to the "no" and can bring us closer to the deeper yes through the yes-sive-no. A wholeness that can hold and work with the totality. It doesn't have to be perfect but there is a sense of attending to it that then widens our capacity to bear more. That is the practice. When we are communicating, that is when the medicine gets flowing and our capacity becomes greater. But with that power comes a double movement for holding more suffering as well. The metaxu of an equanimity between oppositions, not fully resolved but balanced. Not counterfeit yeses but the communication of a deeper affirmation, our original affirmation.

The key recognition here is that your affirmation and negation is not just an existential but a bodily, ontological concern. It takes our "multimodal" ways of knowing to bear the excess of reality. To receive the medicine. 

To suffer and undergo the ordeal in that sense is to restore communication to ourselves and the world. But what if we do not take the communication? What if we cannot receive it? The capacity for horror, the absurd arises from that failure. No resolution but failure of communication. Every comprehension itself is an "acute incomprehension" and exposed to the hyperintelligible there always remains a part inaccessible, incommunicable, one that remains enigmatic and fiery at the center of things, a terrible power and infinite source of energy that flows directly to us. A new form of knowing occurs: our unknowing-sive-knowing. A knowing that is closer to a kind of touching, an encounter contact with the divine that feels as a confirmation of ourselves with God. (Is this what Eckhart calls the godhead?) Being becomes communion. Being at that state is a pure nakedness before God. And after everything is burned away what remains is an entry into the palace in a union-in-difference. Our neediness is replaced with peace. We are already forgiven.

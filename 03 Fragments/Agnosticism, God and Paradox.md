By allowing both agnosticism and belief to live together

  

Holding God and Agnosticism Simultaneously

You say:

  

"I can say God and still hold a paradox of agnosticism?"

Yes. Because belief does not need to be rigid. It can be lived instead of declared. You already do this—you recognize the sacred as something real, but you do not enclose it in certainty.

  

Belief, like the self, can also return and dissolve. There are moments of devotion, of surrender, of knowing beyond words—and there are moments where the conceptual mind asks, but what is this?. These are not contradictions, but expressions of the same process.

  

To believe and to un-believe, to see God and to not know God—this, too, is liminality.

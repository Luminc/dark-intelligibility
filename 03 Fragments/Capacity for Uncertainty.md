What felt most resonant to me now was the discussion of the oscillation in the metaxu. Being filled or being emptied. I pray to god to rid me of god. The no-sive-yes. Transtheism ( although I dislike the term sacred atheism ) is still a fascinating idea that conjures up thr provocative idea of nonbinary theism ( playing with language from gender politics) The start of that is here:

> "I consider myself religious, but I also subscribe to being an agnostic theist. I would rather like to affirm the tension, porosity, unknowing, through a term like transtheism. [[Eckhart]]'s words "I pray to God to rid me of God". And [[Nishitani]]'s Sunyata: a nothingness that reveals presence in its suchness.
>
> I see myself oscillating between [[William Desmond|Desmond]] and Nishitani. A trembling and oscillation that is emptied of God and filled by God. In this transjective space, this middle way, a sense of letting-be brings peace. Open to receive, open to be emptied. There is [[kenosis]] here, and [[metanoia]]. It is devotion to the intimacy of the impersonal."

The parts about sacred atheism have to be scrapped. I would never ascribe to atheism, it is the counterfeit doubles, our false idols, that need killing. Like Eckharts words. If mystery is indetermination then there still is a strange tension with us trying to make it intelligible through the limits of that intelligibility. That is us coming to the veil in worship. We may come and sit at the palace door but even though the door does not open we sit patiently.

This builds our capacity for uncertainty, which allows us to be more open to the world. It allows us to be at peace in our process. Understanding is not discarded but in playful dynamism with our non-understanding. Sometimes they collapse into each other in paradoxical interpenetration. This is Dark Intelligibility.
